                 Why have an Australian Curriculum?

 The first Australian Curriculum was released in 2010 to improve the quality, equity and transparency of Australia’s education system.

                 What are the 3 dimensions of the Australian Curriculum?

 The Australian Curriculum has 3 dimensions comprising 8 discipline-based learning areas; 7 general capabilities; and 3 cross-curriculum priorities. The learning areas (and the disciplines from which they are drawn) provide the foundation for essential learning in the Australian Curriculum. The general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities provide opportunities to enrich the content of the learning areas, where most appropriate and authentic; they are not separate learning areas or subjects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Read more about the structure of the Australian Curriculum&nbsp;<a href=\&#34;https://v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/f-10-curriculum-overview\&#34;>here</a>.</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-8766a928d7" class="cmp-text ">

                 Is the Australian Curriculum taught in all schools across the country?

 Implementation of the Australian Curriculum is the responsibility of states and territories who decide when their schools will implement the curriculum. Schools implement the Australian Curriculum according to jurisdictional and system policies and schedules, and develop programs that meet the educational needs of their students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The curriculum comes alive in the hands of teachers who make expert decisions about how best to deliver the curriculum to meet the needs and interests of their students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-20bbb5efc0" class="cmp-text ">

                 Are there indicative hours for the Australian Curriculum subjects?

 ACARA provides indicative time allocations for all subjects as a guide for schools and education authorities. Time allocations for delivery of subjects in schools are determined by relevant education authorities in each state or territory, or by an individual school.</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-3553e459ab" class="cmp-text ">

                 Do you have to teach all the elaborations?

 The elaborations that appear under content descriptions are examples of how the content could be addressed and therefore do not have to be taught. They give guidance to teachers about age-appropriate contexts, activities, and tasks. Teachers can choose to base their teaching on one or more elaborations or plan their own activities. The elaborations have been written in consultation with teachers, critical friends, and reference groups.</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-bb73e56feb" class="cmp-text ">
