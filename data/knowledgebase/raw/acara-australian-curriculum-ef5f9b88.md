     Welcome to the Australian Curriculum website, built for Version 9 of the curriculum.

 We've designed this website with teachers, for teachers, and there's a range of features to help you to view, explore and plan with the Australian Curriculum.

 And easily explore connections between the three dimensions of the Australian Curriculum: the learning areas, general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities.

 Of the three dimensions, the learning areas are the foundations of the Australian Curriculum.

 They identify the essential content that teachers should teach and students should learn.

 The other two dimensions, the general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities, are developed through the learning areas.

 They are not taught separately, but offer opportunities to enrich and enhance the learning areas.

 The website has been specially designed so that teachers can quickly find the information they need.

 All the information about the F-10 curriculum is available from the top menu.

 The selector tool allows you to view each learning area, general capability and cross-curriculum priority.

 You can explore more information about the three dimensions in the curriculum overview pages.

 You can also find resources for planning and teaching the curriculum, and information about the implementation of the national curriculum in your state or territory.

 There's also information on senior secondary subjects and student diversity, and a quick menu to download curriculum materials, as well as help pages and a search tool.

 We'll be continuing to add new features to the website.

 Sign up to the ACARA newsletter to keep up to date on what's new.

     Welcome to the Australian Curriculum.

 Our website makes it easy for teachers to explore learning areas, general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities using the selector tool.

 Let's start by exploring a learning area. Select a subject, then a year level, or multiple year levels.

 You'll see an invitation to understand the learning area. Click to view the rationale, aims, structure and key considerations.

 Explore key connections to general capabilities, cross-curriculum priorities and other learning areas.

 Selecting multiple year levels shows three levels at a time, shown here highlighted in gold. Click the single year button to see just one year level.

 Each year or band level has a description with an overview of the learning students should experience.

 Hovering over any word in blue text will give you a definition.

 The achievement standard describes the expected quality of learning students should typically demonstrate.

 Content descriptions specify the essential knowledge, understanding and skills that students are expected to learn, and are organised in strands.

 Three strands are shown at a time. Use the strand tabs to view each strand.

 Content descriptions are connected to achievement standards, and it's easy to explore those connections.

 Select any sentence in the achievement standard, and see that sentence in an overlay, with all related content descriptions shaded below.

 The numbers in each strand show where to find content descriptions.

 The overlay stays on screen so you can see the relationship.

 To close the highlight, tap here or select a different part of the achievement standard.

 Content descriptions are shown with icons. Hover over the icon to see the full name of the capability or priority.

 To view content elaborations and related content, tap here.

 You can see how the content description relates to the general capabilities.

 Numeracy and Digital Literacy are tagged here, and you can see the relevant element and sub-element, as well.

 Tap into the sub-element to view the continuum extract, starting with the aligned level description.

 You can also view the level above or below.

 Tap the arrow to return the content description, and scroll down to view the elaborations.

 Tapping on the accordion opens each elaboration.

 The Related Content section shows content descriptions from the same level in other learning areas that address the same concept.

 Identifying these connections can support students to connect their learning across the curriculum.

 Switch to Detailed View to see all the elaborations on screen, as well as the content description.

 or a more focused view, select specific strands using the Advanced Select menu.

 Use Advanced Select to filter for particular cross-curriculum priorities or general capabilities.

 Let's try filtering for Critical and Creative Thinking.

 You can still tap into a content description to read more and close it to continue exploring.

 Every view of the curriculum is also shareable.

 Copy the URL, and you can share or save it as a favourite.

 Now let's look at viewing multiple learning areas.

 View different areas for the same year level by selecting the year you're interested in.

 All learning area background information is available from the Understand these Learning Areas overlay.

 In this view, the subjects are shown in each column.

 Tap Collapse All to see the structure of each subject, and use the subject tabs to move between them.

 View individual subjects and use Expand All to read the curriculum in detail, or switch to the Detailed View.

 The content description slide-out works from here, too.

 To find connections between aspects of the curriculum, narrow your view to just some strands using the Advanced Select tool.

 Tapping on the strand selector will give you all available strands for each learning area or subject. Make your selection and explore across the learning area.

 You can also use the selector tool to explore the General Capabilities and Cross-curriculum priorities.

 Select the capability you want.

 You can read more, or tap close and view the information later, from the Understand this General Capability button.

 Each capability is comprised of elements.

 Explore the elements with the tabs.

 Scroll down to see the continuum for each sub-element.

 Icons at each level show learning areas that have connected content descriptions or elaborations at each level.

 Hover over icons to see the learning area name.

 When you select an icon, you'll be taken to the relevant content description in the learning area.

 You can view cross-curriculum priorities in a similar way.

 Return to the selector, select Cross-curriculum Priorities, choose a priority and Submit.

 You can read more about the priority or explore the brief overview before scrolling down to view the organising ideas.

 And scroll down to see the connections between the organising ideas and the learning areas.

 We hope these enhanced functions make it easy to view and use the digital Australian Curriculum.
