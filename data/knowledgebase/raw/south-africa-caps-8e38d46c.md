	  About Basic Education

	   The Department of Basic Education was formed when the former National Department of Education was split into two: Department of Basic Education and the Department of Higher Education and Training. The DBE deals with all schools from Grade R to Grade 12, including adult literacy programmes. The aim of the DBE is to develop, maintain and support a South African school education system for the 21st century.

    Our vision  is of a South Africa in which all our people will have access to lifelong learning, education and training opportunities, which will, in turn, contribute towards improving the quality of life and building a peaceful, prosperous and democratic South Africa.

    Our mission  is to provide leadership in the establishment of a South African education system for the 21st century.

   The Department of Basic Education adheres to the following  values

     People:   Upholding the Constitution, being accountable to the Minister, the government and the people of South Africa.

     Excellence:   Maintaining high standards of performance and professionalism by aiming for excellence in everything we do, including being fair, ethical and trustworthy in all that we do.

     Teamwork:   Cooperating with one another and with our partners in education in an open and supportive way to achieve shared goals.

     Learning:   Creating a learning organisation in which staff members seek and share knowledge and information while committing themselves to personal growth.

     Innovation:   Striving to address the training needs for high-quality service and seeking ways to achieve our goals.
