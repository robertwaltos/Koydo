    Details

              The statutory primary national curriculum, including programmes of study and attainment targets, for all subjects at key stages 1 and 2. Languages are only statutory at key stage 2.

 These must be taught in all local-authority-maintained primary schools in England.

 The statutory primary national curriculum is issued by law, which means you must follow it unless there is a good reason not to.

 Schools are not required by law to teach the example content in [square brackets] or the content indicated as being ‘non-statutory’.

 The  individual programmes of study for key stages 1 and 2  are also available for each subject.

 Further information about the  pre-2014 primary curriculum  is available on the National Archives.
