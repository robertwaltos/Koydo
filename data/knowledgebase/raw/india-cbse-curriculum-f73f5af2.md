SYLLABUS FOR ASSAMESE (CODE 014)
2024-25
Background:
North East India is an important and integral part of India. It can be considered as mini India
in which amalgamation of many ethnic groups, culture and languages took place in a healthy
way. So, without knowing the language one cannot understand the vibrant culture of this
region, which is the main reason for learning the language. This language has many similarities
with languages like Oriya, Bengali, Hindi as scholars agreed that all these langu ages have
origin in Sanskrit. It is a very rich language and developed since 13th century. Subsequently
contributed by many great scholars, writers, poets, dramatists, as a result it played a pivotal
role in inculcating national and emotional integration in the minds of young students reading
in secondary and senior secondary level. This language should not be taught only enabling to
read articles, stories, poems , etc. but as an area of activities to develop learners’ creativity,
imagination and equip them with communication skills through speaking, reading and writing.
OBJECTIVES:
 The Board objectives of teaching of Assamese at secondary stage are:
 To build greater confidence and proficiency in oral and written communication. To develop
the ability and knowledge required in order to engage in independent reflection and inquiry.
 To use appropriate Assamese to communicate with various social settings. Equip learners with
essential language skills to question and to articulate their point of view.
 To build competence in the different registers of Assamese.
 To develop sensitivity to and appreciation of other varieties of Assamese like any other Indian
language and the culture they reflect.
 To enable the learner to access knowledge and information through reference skill(consulting
a dictionary, library, internet, etc )
 To develop curiosity and creativity through extensive reading.
 To facilitate self - learning to enable them to become independent learners. To review,
organise and edit their own work and work done by peers.
At the end of this stage, learners will be able to do the following:
 Give a brief oral description of events/ incidents of topical interests.
 Retell the contents of authentic audio text(weather reports, public announcements, simple
advertisements, short interviews, etc))
 Participate in conversation, discussion, etc. on topics of mutual interest in non - classroom
situations.
 Narrate the story depicted pictorially or in any non-verbal mode.

 Section A: Reading: There will be no options. All direct questions.
  Section B: Writing part will have internal options in respect to essay, report writ ing,
Phakara Jojana and sentence framing.
 Section C: Grammar being a vast course, internal options should be given to all the
students.
 Section D: In the textbook part, it is desired that the students should go through the
medieval and ancient literature. Keeping this in view prose and poetry have been
selected from the prescribed textbook assigning 10 marks separately for the both part
(prose and poetry). Optional questions should be set from all the chapters for
convenience of the learners.
