       National curriculum in England: complete framework for key stages 1 to 4 - for teaching from September 2016

         PDF  ,  2.78 MB ,  264 pages

    Details

              This is the statutory national curriculum framework. It is issued by law; you must follow it unless there’s a good reason not to. The framework includes the programmes of study for all subjects for key stages 1 to 4.

 The national curriculum sets out the programmes of study and attainment targets for all subjects at all 4  key stages .

 All local-authority-maintained schools in England must teach these programmes of study.

 The majority of this national curriculum was introduced in September 2014, with English and maths coming into force for all year groups from September 2016.

 The exception is the science curriculum which came into force for year 10 pupils in September 2016, and applies to year 11 pupils from September 2017.

 Separate versions containing just the  primary (key stages 1 to 2)  and  secondary (key stages 3 to 4)  curriculums are also available.

 The  HTML  version covers chapters 1 to 7 of the national curriculum framework document. These set out:

   contextual information about the school curriculum and the statutory national curriculum

   statements on inclusion and the development of pupils’ competence in numeracy and mathematics, language and literacy

 Separate individual programmes of study are available for:

    English

    mathematics

    science

    art and design

    citizenship

    computing

    design and technology

    geography

    history

    languages

    music

    physical education

 See the National Archives website for information about the pre-2014  primary  and  secondary  curriculums.
