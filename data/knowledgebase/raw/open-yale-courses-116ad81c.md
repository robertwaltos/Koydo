              Roman Architecture with Diana E. E. Kleiner

              "To construct soaring vaults out of concrete, to face them with brick, to create windows large enough to dematerialize the wall - to do that at this kind of scale is an incredible architectural feat."

              Milton with John Rogers

              "In our collective cultural consciousness, whether we like him or not, we tend to think of John Milton as powerful."

              Financial Markets (2011) with Robert J. Shiller
