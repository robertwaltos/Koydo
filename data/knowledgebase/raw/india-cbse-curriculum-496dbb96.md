1. PRINCIPLES OF THE CBSE CURRICULUM
1.1 CBSE Curriculum
The curriculum in broad term reflects nation’s shared vision of education encompassing local, national
and global needs and expectations. Empirically, it may be regarded as the sum total of a planned set
of educational experiences provided to a learner by a school to attain stipulated competencies using
specified content, pedagogical practices and assessment guidelines  etc. CBSE’s curriculum strives to
provide opportunities for students to achieve excellence in learning  as envisioned in the National
Education Policy-2020.
1.2 Salient Features of the CBSE Secondary School Curriculum
The Curriculum prescribed by CBSE strives to:
i. provide ample scope for holistic i.e., physical, intellectual and social development of students;
ii. emphasize constructivist rather than rote learning by highlighting the importance of hands -
on experience;
iii. enlist general and specific teaching and assessment objectives to make learning competency-
based and attain mastery over laid down competencies;
iv. encourage the application of knowledge and skills in real-life problem-solving scenarios;
v. uphold the ‘Constitutional Values’ by encouraging values-based learning activities;
vi. promote 21st Century Skills, Life Skills, Financial Literacy, Digital Literacy, Health and Wellness,
Road Safety, Citizenship Education, Disaster Management and multilingualism;
vii. integrate innovations in pedagogy such as experiential, activity centered, joyful learning, Sport
& Art -Integrated Learning, toy -based pedagogy, storytelling, gamification etc. with
technological innovations (ICT integr ation) to keep pace with the global trends in various
disciplines;
viii. promote inclusive practices as an overriding consideration in all educational activities;
ix. enhance and support learning by different types of assessments; and
x. strengthen knowledge and attitude related to livelihood skills;
xi. foster multilingual and multicultural learning and national understanding in an
interdependent society;
xii. integrate environmental education in various disciplines from classes I- XII.

1.3 Curriculum Areas at Secondary Level
CBSE envisions the all -round development of students in consonance with the holistic approach to
education and, therefore, has done away with artificial boundaries between the co-curricular and the
curricular domains.
Secondary Curriculum provides students  with a broad and balanced understanding of subjects
including languages, Mathematics, Science, and Social Science to enable students to communicate
effectively, analyse and interpret information meaningfully, make informed decisions, construct their
worldview in alignment with constitutional values, and progress smoothly to be productive future
citizens. The recent focus of CBSE is on developing 21st -century skills in settings where each student
feels independent, safe, and comfortable with learning. The Board hopes that schools will try to align
the curriculum in a way children feel more connected to it and employ their learning in real -life
contexts. To achieve this aim, it is essential that children acquire adequate knowledge and skills in
other core are as like Health and Physical Education, Life Skills, Values Education, Art Education,
Financial Literacy, Digital Literacy, and Work Education.
In an operational sense, the secondary curriculum is learner-centered with school being a place where
students wo uld be acquiring various skills; building self -concept, a sense of enterprise, aesthetic
sensibilities, and sportsmanship. Therefore, for the purpose of fostering core competencies in
learners, this curriculum encompasses major learning areas as under:

i. Languages
Languages include Hindi, English and 38 other languages. The curricula in languages focus on
listening, speaking, reading and writing skills and, hence, develop effective proficiencies in all
these areas . Learners use language to comprehend, acquire and communicate ideas in an
effective manner. CBSE also encourage schools to provide a multilingual and multicultural
experiences to promote national integration.
ii. Social Science
Social Science (Geography, History, Economics and Political Science) intends to make learners
understand how people behave, interact and influence the world  within their cultural,
geographical and historical milieus and gain in -depth knowledge, attitude, skills and values
necessary to bring about transformation for a better  world. It aims to develop the ability to
analyse complex social, political, historical, economic and environmental issues, think
critically, assess different solutions, understand diffe rent perspectives, and effectively
communicate information . Social Science includes the learning of history and culture,
geographical environment, global institutions, constitutional values  and norms, politics,
economy, interpersonal and societal interactions, civic responsibilities and the incorporation
of the above -mentioned learning. Learners appreciate and value everyone’s right to feel
respected and safe, and, also understand their Fundamental Rights  and Duties and behave
responsibly in the society.
iii. Science
Science: (Biology, Chemistry and Physics) seeks to explain the rules that govern the natural
phenomenon through scientific methods. The focus is on knowledge and skills to develop a
scientific temper and to use and apply scientific knowledge for improving the quality of life.
The Curriculum promotes the ability to engage with science related issues, and with the ideas
of science, as a reflective citizen by  being able to explain phenomena scientifically, evaluate
and design scientific enquiry, and interpret data and evidence scientifically.
Students understand the importance of to apply scientific knowledge  in the context of real -
life situations and gain competencies that enable  them to participate effectively and
productively in life.
iv. Mathematics
Mathematics is the abstract science of number, quantity, and space, either as abstract
concepts, or as applied to other disciplines such as sciences, technology and engineering.
Mathematics includes acquiring the concepts related to number sense,  operation sense,
computation, measurement, geometry, probability  and statistics, the skill to calculate and

8

organize, the ability to apply this Knowledge and acquired skills in their daily life and the skills
to think mathematically. It also includes understand ing of the principles  of reasoning and
problem solving. Children learn to rationalize and  reason about pre -defined arrangements,
norms and relationships in  order to comprehend, decode, validate and develop relevant
patterns Mathematics is offered at two di fferent levels i.e. Mathematics (Basic)  &
Mathematics Standard to suit needs of different learners.
v. Skill Electives
According to the National Education Policy 2020 aims to overcome the social status hierarchy
associated with vocational education and integration of vocational education into mainstream
education in all educational institutions in a phased manner. Beginnin g with vocational
exposure at early ages in middle and secondary school, CBSE has started quality vocational
education through 12 -hour modules for classes VI -VIII. In secondary classes Board offers
variety of competency-based subjects under NSQF like Retai l, Information Technology,
Marketing & Sales, Banking, Finance, AI etc. Choosing any one Skill subject at secondary level
can helps the child to pursue what truly interests or pleases him or her. This liberty promotes
a sense of self-esteem in accepting one’s own talents and strengths.
CBSE is actively facilitating the Skill Hubs initiatives in its schools and also looking forward to
operationalise National Credit Framework (NCrF) to enable the integration of academic and
vocational domains to ensure flexibility and mobility between the two.
The curriculum and the study material for the Skill Electives is available on the CBSE academic
website under the tab ‘Skill Education’ and  can be accessed through the link:
http://cbseacademic.nic.in/skilleducation. html.
vi. Art Education
It entails instruction in various art forms (visual as well as  performing) with an aim to help
children develop an interest for arts  and encourage them to enthusiastically participate in
related activities, thus, promoting abilities suc h as imagination, creativity, valuing arts and
cultural heritage. In addition, Arts should be integrated with other subjects to promote
creative thinking and expression
vii. Health and Physical Education
It focuses on holistic development, both mental and physical, understanding the importance
of physical fitness, health, wellbeing and the factors that contribute to them. Focus of this
area is on helping children develop a positive attitude and commitment to lifelong, healthy
active living and the capacity to l ive satisfying, productive lives with the help of health
management, indigenous sports, Yoga, NCC, self-defence, fitness and life style choices.3

9

viii. Work Experience
The Work Experience has been subsumed in the Health and Physical Education; however, it is
an integral part of the curriculum and is given as much as focus as Health and Physical
Education.
1.4 Integrating All Areas of Learning:
All these eight areas are to be integrated with each other in terms of knowledge, skills (life and
livelihood), comprehension, values and attitudes. Children should get opportunities to think laterally,
critically, identify opportunities, challenge their potential and be open to new ideas. Children should
be engaged in practices that promote physical, cognitive, emo tional and social development and
wellbeing, connect different areas of knowledge, application and values with their own lives and the
world around them. The holistic nature of human learning and knowledge should be brought forth
while transacting the curriculum to make them good citizens who can contribute in making the world
a happy place.
2. IMPLEMENTATION OF CURRICULUM
2.1 School Curriculum Committee
The Board mandates that all schools must setup a School Curriculum Committee comprising teachers
from each area. The School Curriculum Committee would define activities for pedagogical practices,
evolve a plan of assessment and mechanism of feedback and reflection and ensure its
implementation. The committee would also ensure that the textbooks/ reference materials  are age
appropriate, incorporate inclusive principles, gender sensitive, have valid content and do not contain
any material which may hurt the sentiments of any community. The committee will then send the list
of books to the principal to take action as p er para 2.4.7 (b) of the Affiliation Byelaws, 2018. The
committee would also ensure that the reference materials reflect conformity with the underlying
principles of the Constitution of India and are compliant with NEP -2020. Issues of gender, social,
cultural and regional disparities must be taken care of in the curriculum transaction.
2.2 Pedagogical Leadership
All Principals have a crucial role to play in the evolution of the teaching learning ecosystem as the
Head and pedagogical leader of their schools. In the role of school pedagogical leader, the principal is
expected to undertake the following:

10

i. Lead, Guide and Support the teachi ng and learning processes in the school by focusing on
classroom specific requirements for transacting the curriculum, so that bo th teachers and
students perform at their optimal best.
ii. Direct the entire focus of all school activities towards the students’ learning and acquiring of
necessary competencies. Every activity taken up by the school, therefore, should be mapped
for the educ ational competencies, and for life skills, values, etc., being acquired by the
students.
iii. Prepare Annual Pedagogical Plan of the school by designing and developing annual plan for
the school by giving equal importance to all areas.
iv. Promote innovative pedagogy, with special focus on integrating art, sports and ICT
(Information and Communication Technology) with education, and use of active and
experiential learning methods in the classrooms.
v. Ensure joyful learning at all levels through use of such innovative pedagogy.
vi. Develop school specific resources for teaching and learning, in the form of lesson plans, e -
content, use of mathematics and science kits developed by NCERT, etc.
vii. Ensure proper in-house training of teachers in the school to enable them to unleash their own
unique capabilities and creativity in their classrooms.
viii. To be up to date with all new ideas and tools, etc. being used in education at the global level
and constantly innovate the pedagogy of the school.
ix. To make efforts to learn from the best practices of other schools, by arranging for discussions
with Principals of such schools, or through observation visits of teachers to other schools.
The Board has not laid down the structure or format of the annual pedagogical  plan as the Board
respects educational autonomy of every school and expects  each school to prepare its own unique
and innovative annual plan. This plan  must be an implementable one with realistic timelines that
should include administrative inputs and detailed pedagogical aspects.
2.3 Pedagogical Practices by Teachers
The pedagogical practices should be learner centric. Teachers are expected  to ensure such an
atmosphere for students where they feel free to ask  questions. They would promote active learning
among students with a  focus on reflections, connecting with the world around them, creating and
constructing knowledge. The role of a teacher should be that of a facilitator  who would encourage
collaborative learning and development of multiple  skills through the generous use of resour ces via
diverse approaches for transacting the curriculum.

11

Teachers should follow inclusive principles and not label children as ‘slow learners’ or ‘bright students’,
or ‘problem children’. They should instead  attend to the individual difference of student s by
diagnosing and modifying  their pedagogic planning. As far as possible, Arts should be integrated in
teaching, especially while teaching the concept which students find difficult to understand.
2.4 Competency Based Learning
Challenges of 21st Century necessitate education to be competency focussed to enable continuous
watch on achievement of learning objectives and plan interventions. Competency focussed learning
underscores the student’s demonstration of  desired learning outcomes as central to the learning
process. Learning outcomes are statements of expected outcomes that the student will be able to do
to know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate after completion  of a process of learning as a
result of learning the activity. Therefore, the  focus is on  measuring learning through attainment of
prescribed learning outcomes.
Experiential and active learning are the preferred pedagogies  for Competency focussed Learning as
they promote critical thinking, creativity and effective study skills among students. Learning Outcomes
developed by NCERT for classes I -X that is enclosed with each subject  should be adopted by all the
schools and teaching-learning process may be accordingly aligned. The schools are expected to have
well-defined Learning objectives for every grade that are observable and measurable, and empower
learners to focus on mastery of valuable skills and knowledge. It is expected that teachers will provide
meaningful and joyful learning experiences to the students by adopting variety of  innovative
pedagogies or instructional activities and go beyond textbooks.  Schools are expected to track the
attainment of Learning Outcomes by each learner and ensure that no child is left behind.
CBSE has also come out with suggestive mapping of learning outcomes with NCERT curriculum which
can be adopted/ adapted by schools. CBSE has also developed many resources to map  learning
outcomes with pedagogy and assessment to enable tracking of learning progress and these resources
are available at the website of CBSE. Schools are advised to attempt this mapping and use of innovative
pedagogies to achieve learning objectives.
The Board has developed Learning standard frameworks for all  major subjects i.e. , Hindi, English,
Science, Social Science and Mathematics.  The learning standard framework (LSF) offers a structured
conceptual map for integrating the discrete elements such as learning outcomes, content, pedagogies
and assessments, into a coherent continuum. Its goal is to demystify  the 'evidence of learning' and
engender a common understanding of it in  teachers and examiners by cataloguing competencies in
clear, measurable,  and contextualized achievement standards. Combining theory and practice,

12

different LSFs detail how the learning and assessment need to be conducted  in classrooms, these
frameworks contain detailed guidelines for preparing  reliable and valid items along with sample
questions and marking scheme for assessment. Model question paper designs have also been laid out
our helping teachers prepare the question paper.
2.5 Lesson/Unit Plan
Specific Lesson Plans for the topics are to be prepared by the teachers.  These plans may have the
following parts:

2.6 Classroom and School Environment
School environment should be conducive to holistic development of the  students of varying
backgrounds. As part of their policy schools should adopt practices which will promote mental health
by following the guidelines issued by the Board on making the school a No-Anger Zone or Anger Free
Zone. The Board has also developed school he alth manuals which are  available on
www.cbseacademic.nic.in. The time table in the school should  take care of proper rest and the
children learn subjects with relaxation. School must also ensure that Children avoid the intake of junk
food and should ban it  around school premises. Intake of the healthy foods should be  encouraged
with activities described in circular issued by CBSE.
As the surroundings and daily life activities and situations are the best  experiential teachers for the
students, t eachers need to make efforts to  draw examples and group activities from daily life
observations within the classroom/within the school and surroundings, and encourage presentations
and reflection by the students once the activity is completed, to develop  the skills of critical thinking
and communication.

13

Children learn a lot through peer learning. To promote peer learning,  flexible seating arrangements
may be made available during the classroom  transactions. The seating should also take care of the
needs of the students  with disabilities as well. Learning should focus on individual differences  and
promote collaborative learning. The classroom activities must be  connected to the immediate
environment of children. The school should maintain connection with the parents and the progress of
children should be communicated to the parents, and, if needed remedial measures be taken  up for
improving the learning outcomes.
2.7 Creating Cross-Curricular Linkages
Creating cross-curricular linkages are vital to learning as they help to  connect prior knowledge with
new information. For example, Mathematical  data handling and interpretation can be effectively
applied in geography and science. Children can write better-framed answers in history, geography and
science when they have learnt how to write explanations/ short descriptions in a language. Similarly,
Life Skills like empathy, problem  solving and interpersonal communications can be easily integrated
with the study of literature and other areas. Universal Values, Life Skills and Constitutional Values with
emphasis on realization of Fundamental Duties  may be incorporated depending upon context in
almost all the subjects.
2.8 Special Emphasis on Integrating Arts in Education
All disciplines being pursued by students at all stages requir e creative thinking and problem-solving
abilities. Therefore, when Art is integrated with education, it helps the child apply art-based enquiry,
investigation and  exploration, critical thinking and creativity for a deeper understanding of  the
concepts/topics. Secondly, Art Integrated learning is a strong contender for experiential learning, as it
enables the student to derive meaning and  understanding, directly from the learning experience.
Thirdly, this kind of integration not only makes the teaching and l earning process joyful, it also has a
positive impact on the development of certain life skills, such as communication skills, reflection and
enquiry skills, un -conditioning of the  mind leading to higher confidence levels and self -esteem,
appreciation for aesthetics and creativity, etc. Fourthly, this kind of integration broadens the mind of
the student, and enables him/her to see the multi-disciplinary links between subjects, topics, and real
life. Schools are, thus, required to take up the integration of Art with the teaching learning process.
It must be understood that Art Education and Art Integrated Education may be mutually exclusive, but
they build upon each other and strengthen  each other. Art Education is not only relevant for
developing creativity and appreciation of art among students, but is also necessary for inculcating art-

14

based enquiry skills in the students. Art Education is a necessary  precursor for the adoption of Art
Integrated learning.
2.8.1 Art Education and Art Integration
The following two-pronged approach is followed:
i. Art education continues to be an integral part of the curriculum. The  schools may also
promote and offer Visual and Performing Arts based  subjects at the Secondary and Senior
Secondary level.
ii. Art is also integrated with the te aching and learning process of all  subjects from classes 1 to
12, to promote active and experiential learning for “connecting knowledge to life outside the
school, ensuring that learning shifts away from rote methods and for enriching the curriculum,
so that it goes beyond textbooks.”
2.8.2 Art Integrated Pedagogy
While preparing its annual pedagogical plan under the leadership of the  Principal of the school, the
school must plan out in detail the Art Education to be imparted at various levels, and how that Art can
be integrated with classroom learning of various subjects. The focus must be on mutually reinforcing
Art as a subject and Art as a tool for learning, with efforts towards seamless integration. Team teaching
(combination of subject teachers and Art teachers) would also strengthen the integration.
For implementing this in classrooms, the subject teacher picks the topic/ concept/idea that she wants
to teach by integrating Art. The teacher can do this jointly with the Art teacher too. Then, the subject
teacher collaborates  with the Art teacher to align the pedagogy. Next, the teacher teaches the
topic/concept/idea ensuring active learning and ensuring that both the subject and Art are integrated
well and there is learning in both areas. Finally, the teacher prepares a rubric to assess the student in
both the areas – that is, the topic taught and the Art used.
2.9 21st Century Skills
There is an increased awareness among the educators of the need to integrate what are called as 21st
Century skills in educational systems. There are three key 21stcentury skills;

15

There are three major 21st century skills i.e. Learning Skills, Literacy Skills and Life Skills.

The need of the hour is that schools must focus on enhancing the skills required for a successful adult
life in 21st Century. It is important that the students are able to think scientifically, mathematically or
artistically to face the real-life challenges in an information and technology driven world and enhance
their inherent potential. CBSE has published a handbook on 21st century skills available at its website.
Schools may further refer to it.
2.10 Inclusive Education
Inclusive approach in education is a prerequisite for ensuring full participation of all students with
equal opportunity in all areas without any discrimination. Inclusive attitude in all staff and faculty
members is crucial for successful inclusive education. Therefore, all the members of teaching and non-
teaching staff should be sensitized on the issues of inclusive education. Students without  disabilities
should also be sensitized.
Schools must organize these sensitization programmes with the support of experts from respective
field of disabilities. Capacity Building Programmes on Inclusive Education may be organized in
collaboration with the CBSE- Centres of Excellence. Board has made the appointment of special
educator mandatory to all the schools affiliated to the CBSE. Special Educators must possess the
qualification as prescribed by the Rehabilitation Council of India (CBSE Circular No. 31/2015). CBSE has
published a handbook on Inclusive Education which is available at its website.

3.3 Instructional Time
Instructional time shall be as per the subjects selected. Schools must ensure that minimum number of
hours are spent for each subject as specified in the curriculum. The time duration for the subjects has
been clearly indicated in the syllabus of each subject. However, it is expected that schools will create
innovative Timetables (such as, teaching-learning only 2 or 3 subjects per day etc.) to ensure that the
burden of the bag and homework are substantially reduced and the classroom transaction are based

24

on experiential processes. Schools may also think of introducing bag -less day and same may be
incorporated in the time tables. The time table must also include the mandatory periods for
compulsory areas including Health and Physical Education.
3.4 Medium of Instruction
The medium of instruction in general in all the schools affiliated with the Board shall either be Hindi
or English for classes IX – X.
4. STRUCTURE OF ASSESSMENT SCHEME
The Assessment scheme will have an 80 marks component for Board examination (class X) and Annual
Examination (class IX) in all subjects except compulsory subjects to be assessed internally along with
a 20 marks component of Internal Assessment. Students have to secure 33 percent in total in each of
these components.
This condition has been relaxed vide Notification No. CBSE/Coord/DS/EC dated11/10/2018 available
at: https://www.cbse.gov.in/cbsenew/Examination_Circular/2018/15_CIRCULAR.pdf
As the Board is progressively allowing more space to 'learning outcome based' assessment in place of
textbook driven assessment, question papers of Board examinations have more questions based on
real-life situations requiring students to apply, analyse, evaluate and synthesize information as per the
stipulated outcomes. The core  competencies to be assessed in all questions, however, will be from
the prescribed syllabus and textbooks recommended therein. This will eliminate predictability and
rote learning to a large extent.
4.1 Board Examination for (Class X) and Annual Examination (class IX) for 80 marks For Class X:
The Board Examination in each subject will cover entire syllabus of Class -X. Grades corresponding to
the marks shall be on the basis of 9 -point grading system. Grades will be awarded in each scholastic
subject. For awarding the grades, the Board will put all the passed students in a rank order and will
award the grades as follows:
Grade Octile
A-1 Top 1/8th of the passed candidates
A-2 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates
B-1 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates
B-2 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates
C-1 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates

25

C-2 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates
D-1 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates
D-2 Next 1/8th of the passed candidates
E* Essential Repeat
Notes: -
i. Minor variations in proportion of candidates to adjust ties will be made.
ii. In case of a tie, all the students getting the same score, will get the same grade. If the number
of students at a score point need to be d ivided into two segments, the smaller segment will
go with the larger.
iii. Method of grading will be used in subjects where the number of candidates who have passed
is more than 500.
iv. In respect of subjects where total number of candidates passing a subject is less than 500, the
grading would be adopted on the pattern of grading and distribution in other similar subjects.
For Class IX:
The assessment scheme will be similar to class X Board examination. However, the grading in class IX
will be as follows:
Grading Scale for Scholastic Areas (Class-IX)
(School will award grades as per the following grading scale)
MARKS RANGE GRADE
91-100 A1
81-90 A2
71-80 B1
61-70 B2
51-60 C1
45-50 C2
33-40 D

 Absolute grading in class IX is used keeping in view the number of students appearing from
any particular school as against positional grading used for class X.
4.2 Internal Assessment (20 Marks):

26

One-time year-end examination is complimented and supplemented with  Internal Assessment (IA)
that assesses students in diverse manner, at  different times and also examines a broad range of
curriculum objectives.  IA, in effect school -based assessment, plays the dual role of providing a
complete picture of students’ abilities or progress towards fulfilling the aims  of education and
informing teachers of students’ progress and therefore supporting classroom learning. It also informs
the individual learner about  his/ her progress over a period of time enabling them to develop
strategies to improve learning.
4.2.1 Periodic Assessment (05 Marks)
The main purpose of Periodic Assessment is to assess the learning progress  of students. Such
Assessment done at regular intervals provides feedback  and insight to teachers regarding learners’
needs and helps them to improve instruction, do remedial teac hing and set curricular targets for a
student or  a group of students. The feedback also helps students to know their errors  as well as
strengths and weaknesses. The students, thus, are enabled for better learning and setting up realistic
goals. In essence, this is assessment for, of and as learning. Periodic Assessment is further divided into
the following:
Periodic Tests (05 marks): As earlier, these would be restricted to 3 in each subject in a year and the
average of best 2 would to be taken for final submission of marks. These tests tend to follow a pattern,
which is quite similar to the final end of course examination, and have a gradually  increasing portion
of content. Hence, they also tend to prepare students for final summative exams in a more confident
manner.
4.2.2 Multiple Assessment (05 marks):
Over the course of the curriculum transaction, multiple assessment strategies are advised. Subject
teachers would determine the type and frequency. Schools/teachers would be able to use multiple
and diverse assessment techniques to assess learners, i.e., observation, oral tests, individual or group
work, class discussion, field-work, concept maps, graphic organizers, visual representation etc. Hence,
the schools are given autonomy to use alternate modes of assessment as per the demand of the
subject and the context towards addressing the goal of assessment for and as learning, such as quizzes,
project-work, Self and peer assessment, collaborative projects, experiments, classroom
demonstrations, etc.
Caution must be exercised to ensure that recording such a ssessment is not cumbersome and can be
easily translated into individual student scores. When choosing a particular technique, developing
simple scoring criteria and rubrics becomes equally important. The purpose of periodic assessment is

27

to provide feedba ck to improve teaching and learning, so it is equally important to use follow -up
measures when students are found to be lacking proficiency.
4.2.3 Portfolio (05 marks):
A portfolio is a collection of chosen work by a student representing a selection of performan ces. It is
a tool for assessing a variety of skills not usually testable in a single setting of the traditional written
paper and pencil tests. Portfolio helps students gain an awareness of their own learning. Peer
Assessment is a great support that facilitates a clear understanding and evaluation of personal goals.
The active role that students plays in self-assessment not only motivates them but also help to develop
metacognitive skills which enable them to make adjustments. The creation of portfolios is suggested
to broaden the scope of learning and achieve diverse curriculum outcomes by examining a range of
evidence of student performances being assessed.
The portfolio may take the form  of a journal or notebook that would include students’ artifacts
selected along with their reflections. Learner here is an active participant involved in constructing his
or her  journey through the portfolio building process of selecting, organizing and  reflecting. It is
suggested that the portfolios would include classwor k and homework assignments that would help
evaluate learner's progress. The attention should be to promote techniques such as annotation,
identification of key words / topics/ themes, summarization and organization of ideas and content,
photos, presentations, assignments, art integrated learning, etc.  Developing them should not be a
burden on students- both in terms of cost and time.
Assessing Portfolios
Students’ portfolio can be effectively evaluated using a simple scoring rubric. The criteria – to be used
in determining the quality of a particular student’s  portfolio needs to be carefully developed and
shared with students. They  key elements of the particular criteria need to be specified as well.
Suggested below are some elements to judge student’s portfolio:

28

4.2.4 Subject Enrichment Activities (05 marks):
Subject enrichment activities aim at enrichment of the understanding and skill development of
students. They provide in -depth learning that motivates students to dig deeper into the discipline.
These enrichment activities need to challenge students and permit them to apply knowledge to the
next level. They ought to provide opportunity to students to explore their own interests as well as an
understanding of the nature of particular discipline. Some suggestions for conducting these activities
are as follows:
Languages provide ample space and the autonomy to subject teachers to  develop relevant listening
and speaking skills. Teachers need to use this  opportunity to full advantage and use excerpts from
relevant suitable literature to develop vocabulary and heighten students’ awareness and sensitivity.
The specified activities in practical work in Science and Mathematics need  to be conducted in
congruence to the objectives of the subject. The focus must shi ft from confirmatory nature  of lab
experiments to explorations that focus on development of science  processes. Students need to be
encouraged to raise questions, generate  hypotheses, experiment, innovate and find solutions to
questions/ problems encountered.
Social science being the subject relevant to social context,  activities and projects in this area should
be related to , society, socio-economic and environmental problems, political theory and art and
culture. I may also include development of Life Skills.
4.3 Art Education
Art Education constitutes curricular activities for the development of the  wholesome personality of
the children, aesthetic sensibilities and respect  for social values and cultural heritage. It encourages
learners to develop  creative exp ression, sharpens keen observation and develops a sense of
organization and order. Exploring into ideas and meanings through the works of artists/experts/
writers/poets, the students would develop imagination and critical awareness. Students may select
one form each from Visual Arts (drawing, painting, murals, collages, crafts, sculpture, etc.) and
Performing Arts (dance, music, drama, puppetry and Folk Art forms etc.).  Children’s participation in
activities/competitions form the basis of assessing the student.
4.4 Health and Physical Education (Sports/Self-Defence/Yoga/NCC etc.)
Focus of this  area of curriculum is on health, hygiene and sanitation,  work experience, indigenous
sports, yoga, NCC, self-defence, fitness and lifestyle choices. Health and Physical Activities, preferably
sports must be given one regular  period per day. Students should be provided opportunities to get

29

professionally trained in the area of their interest. Indigenous sports, yoga and NCC must  be
encouraged in the schools.  Similarly, Self-defence may be actively taught to students, especially girl
students, as it instils confidence and empowers them.
The teachers should  ensure that the students get opportunities to participate in activities of  their
choice and help them in identifying an d nurturing their talents and  gain confidence. The Physical
Education teacher will maintain the record of  all the Health and Physical Education
activities/competitions that each of  the children participate in. The Comprehensive School Health
Manuals (four volumes) brought out by CBSE could be referred to for detailed information  and the
graded activities could be taken up as part of the curriculum in school.
Qualified doctors should examine children annually along with a follow-up session during the year to
address the health aspect of HPE. School should also bring any noticeable disability in a student to the
notice of the school counsellor and parents. Cases of special needs of students  with medical history
must be carefully noted and handled accordingly. Detailed information on the Comprehensive Physical
and Health Education Curriculum is enclosed with this document.
4.5 Assessment of Art Education and Health and Physical Education
Assessment of Art Education and Health and Physical Education may be  continuously done by
collecting information, reflecting on and using that  information to review children’s progress and to
plan future learning experiences. The documented data, after interpretation, should be reflected  in
the Report Card of the children in the form of grades.
In the existing scheme of assessment, these activities will be graded on a  5- point grading scale (A to
E) for classes IX-X and will have no descriptive indicators. The students shall be assessed on two areas
i.e., Art Education, Health and Physical Education. Work Experience is subsumed in the Physical  and
Health Education. No up scaling of grades will be done.
The concerned teacher would make an objective assessment of the level of  performance/
participation demonstrated by a student throughout a year and finally assign grades.
4.5.1 Parameters of Assessment
While the students are engaged in the core areas like Health and Physical Education and Art Education,
the process is as important as the product. Hence, the assessment in these areas should take account
of both aspects.
The basis of assessment has been suggested below:

30

culture and diversity of our nation awareness of
Fundamental Rights and Duties as enshrined in the
Indian Constitution.
19. Art Integrated Project
Application of art-based enquiry, investigation and
exploration, critical thinking and creativity for a deeper
understanding of the concepts/ topics, promotes
experiential learning as it enables to derive meaning
and understanding directly from the learning, enables
students to see the multi-disciplinary linkages between
subjects, topics, and real life.

Schools are encouraged to ensure that their students participate in these activities of the Board for
making the students future-ready and also for becoming a holistic learner.
4.7 Suggestions for Teachers
A teacher is expected to achieve at least all the stipulated class level learning outcomes in her
students. Teachers feel accountable for the progress of her students and act with utmost honesty and
integrity. They must cons tantly do self -assessment of their subject knowledge and skills and strive
hard to keep them up -to-date in this area. Teachers may regularly visit CBSE’s website for latest
updates and must participate in a minimum of 50 hours of annual capacity building programmes at
different levels. Teachers are required to work with other teachers and parents in the best interests
of their students and need to:
i. set high expectations to motivate and challenge students and help students to reflect on
their progress;
ii. carefully go through the curricular aims, and learning outcomes as stipulated in the
National Curriculum Framework for foundational stage 2022 and National Curriculum
Framework for Secondary classes;
iii. analyse the need of her students and innovate or improvi se to address this need in the
best possible manner and facilitate the inculcation of 21st-century skills in her students;
iv. ensure a safe and conducive environment for students as per the statutory provisions
mentioned in the affiliation bye-laws of CBSE;
v. follow inclusive practices for students of varying backgrounds;

33

vi. lead by example by demonstrating constitutional values, positive attitudes, and
behaviour;
vii. help the principal in formulating an annual pedagogic plan and prepare and teach by using
well-structured lesson plans. Also, follow the statuary provision of instructional time and
directions of CBSE regarding Experiential and joyful Pedagogy and Art -integrated
education;
viii. set homework as per the directions of CBSE and plan other activities to consolidate  and
extend the knowledge and understanding students have acquired;
ix. study Assessment Frameworks and other resources to make accurate and productive use
of competency focussed formative and summative assessments. Regularly conduct a
formative assessment to assess the effectiveness of her teaching and use relevant data
to monitor progress, set targets, and plan subsequent lessons;
x. provide students regular feedback and encourage them and their parents to respond to
the feedback;
xi. use effective classroom management skills to ensure a conducive learning environment;
xii. treat students with dignity, and use proper discretion in line with statutory provisions like
RTE-Act, POCSO, CBSE affiliation bye-laws guidelines of NCPCR, etc.;
xiii. maintain high standards in their own attendance and punctuality; and
xiv. perform duties assigned by CBSE from time to time.
4.8 Values Education and Life Skills
Constitutional and universal values should also be encouraged amongst students. Hygiene, sanitation,
dedication, honesty, truthfulness, kindness, empathy respect for the environment, elders and all living
things etc. are the values that our students must a ctively practice. Parents may also support schools
in cultivating disciplined behaviour in their wards. Class teacher will grade the students on a Five- point
scale (A to E) keeping in view the overall attendance, sincerity, values and behaviour of the students.
Values Education Resource Book and Kit developed by CBSE may be used for inculcating values in
students.
Similarly, schools endeavour to inculcate Life Skills and 21 st Century Skills as per the directions and
material developed by CBSE.
4.9 Rules Regarding Admission and Examination
Regarding eligibility for Admission, Eligibility for Examination, Scheme of Examination and related
information, please see the Examination Bye-Laws of CBSE available on www.cbse.nic.in.

35

 For the Foundational Stage, it would be appropriate to develop activity books and other handbooks
for Teachers, that would guide them through the sequence planned in the syllabus. The syllabus
should include broad guidelines for assess ments that check for the achievement of Learning
Outcomes.
ii. Organisation of Content
The selected content should be empirically engaging (e.g., engaging the child's senses) and/or relevant
to their experience. It should be based on the child's experiences and reflect the child's socio-cultural
and geographical context. Furthermore, content should introduce natural and human environments,
the social and physical world, people, places, and living and non -living things. To accommodate the
varied interests of individual children, the content should be diverse and inclusive. Special care should
be taken to preclude the promotion of stereotypes.
Textbooks might be inappropriate for children of ages 3 to 6, activity books can guide Teachers to
sequence activities and learning experiences. Textbooks can be introduced in class 1 and they must
allow for the children's active participation. Workbooks and textbooks ought to be complementary to
one another. Audio -visual materials including flashcards, cardboard -and-sandpaper, shapes of
alphabets, games, and puzzles should adequately supplement textbooks.
When foundational stage children actively engage their hands and employ various senses, they learn
more effectively. It is, thus, important to go beyond textbooks and use  a range of Teaching Learning
Material (TLM) at this Stage, from basic playthings to specific manipulatives for counting and
numeracy. The majority of the TLM needed for the Foundational Stage can be constructed with readily
available low-cost materials. For example, cardboards, straws, packaging material, old clothing, bottle
caps, seeds, and pebbles (for counting), match sticks (without chemicals), discarded paper, coconut
shells, and egg cartons (for sorting). Teachers can bring leftover fabric to create  puppets, soft cloth
balls, and other playthings. Young children can find making basic toys, puzzles, and board games to be
particularly engaging activities that allow them to use all of their developmental domains.
The language content should contain a fa ir mixture of narratives, poetry, and information on local,
natural and social contexts. Content on both flora and fauna as well as social and cultural issues allows
youngsters to grasp the world around them while stories and poems develop young children's
linguistic and imaginative abilities. Schools will aim to ensure the availability of teachers so that at
least two or preferably three languages are taught to children on a regular basis.
Reading and writing should be initially developed through R1 (language in which a child first learns the
concept of reading and writing) which is preferably L1 (mother tongue/ home language / familiar

36

language) whenever possible, via early exposure to oral language development, meaning -making
activities, and print materials. Understanding of phonemes and graphemes and the correspondence
between them (decoding) will be developed through games and interactive exercises. The aim should
be to achieve literacy skills in R1 by Grade 3.
Mathematical content can represent engageme nt with the surrounding environment, much like
language can. Counting and other mathematical tasks can be combined with interactions with the
natural and social settings.
The content of art learning experiences should be derived from the school's local env ironment and
designed as activities centred on specific learning outcomes.
Schools may also make use of the Jadui Pitara (Collection of teaching-learning material) prepared by
NCERT for the teaching-learning process for the Foundational Years. Jadui Pitara is available at DIKSHA
portal. Further, it is recommended that all related Teaching-Learning material for Foundational Stage
being released by NCERT be used for teaching-learning purposes.
iii. Pedagogical Practices
CBSE advocates experiential, activity based and joyful learning. As part of its conceptual, operational,
and transactional approach to curriculum structure, pedagogy, time and content organisation, and the
overall experience of the child, NCF-FS2022 emphasises the significance of "play" as the cornerstone
of these concepts. Play, in addition to sports and games, also includes singing songs, conversations,
toys, stories, music, puzzles, rhymes, art and craft, painting, clay moulding, dancing, etc. Different
children learn at different paces, and in different ways. So, it's crucial to avoid pressurising students
to adopt a certain learning style. Children should be allowed to play with anything that engages them,
is safe and easily available. In early education, experiential learning is essential. Projects give kids the
chance to hone a variety of abilities, especially those that require peer collaboration.
Stories stimulate learning in children, and helps them build their own vocabulary. Stories not only
introduce children to the world outside of the ir immediate experience but also to a wealth of
resources for language learning and developing, helping youngsters acquire much more than just
words. Stories help develop curiosity, imagination and intellect, promote emotional and social growth,
making them an effective tool for children's overall development.
Schools may use thematic approach at this stage as a variety of curriculum areas are connected and
integrated within a theme. Children are assisted in making meaningful connections through a theme
and exploring different themes or elements within the theme as opposed to learning different skills
at different times or learning distinct subjects.

37

Each of the aforementioned strategies has unique merits. A single, particular strategy for teaching and
learning is not recommended. Depending on their environment and needs, teachers and schools are
left to choose the best method for creating learning content and transaction of teaching learning.
iv. Assessment
Overall approach in these years as in all higher classes is also competency focussed assessment using
a variety of techniques. However, assessment should not contribute to any additional burden for the
child, should not overtly burden the teacher and care must be taken not to label the child. Teachers
should try to provide each child individual care and attention and keep observing what they are doing.
The stipulated learning outcomes may not be achieved in a linear fashion for all students. Children
take their time and have their own ups and downs durin g their journey towards achieving these
learning objectives. Teachers, thus, need to be very patient provide adequate space and time to each
child as per her/ his need and not be overbearing. Some of the strategies that can be employed to
assess progress o f children may be guided observation, storytelling etc. Tools of assessment may
include anecdotal records, checklists, event sampling and analysis of artefacts and workbooks.
Teachers should analyse evidence from multiple sources taken over a period of tim e to assess the
extent to which children have demonstrated understanding and acquisition of skills.
There should be no ranking of students at this stage as each child is unique. A teacher can sometimes
accomplish a range of distinct curricular objectives a nd competences just by telling a story, having a
conversation, or playing a game. Therefore, the teacher should have the freedom to conduct activities
as she / he seems fit in the context of their classrooms.
More details can be found in the format of Holistic Progress Card for foundational stage developed by
CBSE.
v. Identification of Developmental Delays
In order to ensure holistic and inclusive education, it is important to ascertain provisional cases of
developmental delay in children significantly lagging  in achieving developmental milestones in
physical, cognitive, communication, social -emotional, behavioural, - or a combination of domains.
NCFFS-2022 emphasizes the importance of early identification and intervention to ensure individual
children receive timely and appropriate help. Though schools and Teachers are not supposed to
confirm developmental delay or disability and should refer the perceptible cases to authorized medical
professionals for diagnose, however, they can take the following steps to identify provisional cases for
referring to clinical diagnosis:

38

Screening: Schools often conduct universal developmental screening to identify children who may be
at risk for developmental delays. These screenings can be done by teachers, school psychologists, or
other professionals using standardized assessment tools.
Teacher observations: Teachers spend a significant amount of time with their students and are well-
positioned to observe developmental delays. Teachers can use checklists or rating scales developed
by World Health Organisation to track their students' developmental  progress and identify areas
where children may need additional support. NCERT’s PRASHAST is a checklist that enables the
identification of children at risk. It comprises two parts - for use by regular teachers for first -level
screening, and for use by spe cial educators and others for second -level screening. It is a safeguard
against unscientific diagnosis and needless labelling of children. It is aligned with the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities Act (RPWD) Act 2016.
Parental concerns: Parents are often the first to notice developmental delays in their children. School
staff should listen to parents' concerns and take appropriate action to assess and address any
developmental concerns.
Standardized testing: Schools may administer standardized tests to ass ess academic skills, cognitive
abilities, or social -emotional development. If a student performs significantly below their peers on
these assessments, it may indicate a developmental delay.
The framework also encourages teachers to work closely with parent s and caregivers to support
children's learning and development. It emphasizes the importance of building strong partnerships
between schools and families to create a supportive and collaborative learning environment for
children.
Schools may make use of p ractical ideas and Sample Individual Education Programmes given in the
framework to identify and support children with developmental delays.
vi. Use of Technology
Technology can be used to enable equitable access to a diverse range of content and material in
diverse forms, spaces, and formats that is contextual for children of varying backgrounds including
Divyang (CWSN) children.
Technology can enhance the learning experience and create new opportunities. It empowers students
to be more creative, connected an d collaborative with their peers and teachers. Using technology
gives the opportunity to develop student’s digital citizenship skills. As use of digital devices is bound
to increase with passage of time, it is important for children to learn from their ini tial years to use

39

digital devices with responsibility.  Technology should also provide an enjoyable experience for the
learner and feed the child’s innate curiosity.
Schools must also use technology in Capacity Building of Teachers, parents, and the community.
vii. The Learning Environment
A welcoming, compassionate environment where collaboration, inquiry, dialogue, and reflection are
commonplace is a prerequisite for effective teaching and learning. Teachers require surroundings that
are resource -rich, inspi ring, and that offer ongoing chances for professional development and
connection.
Access to safe infrastructure viz., potable water, clean and well -maintained restrooms with running
water, arts and crafts supplies, furniture to set up learning corners, an d a variety of children's books
and learning resources must be available to enable a conducive learning environment.
viii. Organisation of Time in the School
The National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage 2022 highlights the importance of careful
planning and organisation of time by allotting adequate and equitable time to all domains to achieve
holistic education of children. Each activity may be planned to keep in mind the attention span of the
child. There may be a balance between child -initiated and Teacher -guided activities, group (whole
group or small group) and individual or pair activities, and alternating activities (e.g., quieter activity
after physical activity, group activity after individual activity, indoor activity after outdoor activity). Art
and Craft, Outdoor Play, and Free Play must have adequate time and focus during the day. Frequent
breaks and transitions may also be provided to allow children to regain their energy and interest.
To achieve this, the curriculum framework recomme nds a balanced distribution of time across
different areas of learning, such as language, mathematics, environmental studies, arts, and physical
education.  Illustrative examples are provided for schools to help in formulating their own schedules.
Similarly, the NCFFS advocates the need for the preparation of an annual calendar detailing all
important school events prior to the commencement of the school academic year. Events of the school
e.g., duration of the school term, vacations, annual day, sp orts day, other school celebrations,
exhibitions/field trips, parent -teacher meetings, teacher professional development programs, and
school meetings may be a part of this calendar.
ix. Culture of the Institution
Fundamentally, if children are loved and cared for, they will learn. Teachers should be kind and
compassionate. The school should be a safe space for all children. Children learn from their parents

40

(the mother being the first teacher), the teacher in the classroom and the environment around.
Therefore, it is vital that the school works seamlessly with the parents and the community to provide
maximum learning opportunities for all children.
x. Teacher Orientation and Continuous Capacity Building
Through a variety of channels, teachers must consistently engage in their professional growth. The
content must address the difficulties teachers confront, be thorough and complete, relevant to the
classroom. It is necessary to provide platforms for peer learning with mentoring and assistance to
teachers. Schools are required to fulfil the mandate given by CBSE regarding annual minimum teacher
training hours.

 Guidelines on National Curriculum Framework for School Education -2023
The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) serves as the guiding framework for
the 5+3+3+4 schooling model proposed in the National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020). The
framework is organized into five parts, covering broad aims, cross-cutting themes, subject-specific
guidelines, school culture, and requirements for an effective schooling ecosystem. It was developed
with a comprehensive approach covering all four stages of schooling, namely the Foundational Stage,
Preparatory Stage, Middle Stage, and Secondary Stage. Schools are advised to follow the following
guidelines for implementing NCF-SE-2023:
1. Ensure Comprehensive Coverage: Implement the framework to address learning standards,
content selection, pedagogy, and assessments for each stage of schooling.

in the Secondary Stage to address contemporary challenges using knowledge from multiple
disciplines.
Further, in line with the NCF-SE 2023, it is imperative for schools to reassess and transform their
approach to assessments. Here are some guidelines to facilitate this transformation across different
stages of schooling:

Foundational Stage:

 Ensure assessment methods are aligned with children's natural learning experiences, avoiding
undue pressure.
 Assessment tools should seamlessly integrate with learning experiences, avoiding the use of
traditional tests and exams.
 Recognize and accommodate the diversity in children's learning styles and expressions,
allowing teachers the flexibility to design various assessment methods effectively.
 Facilitate systematic recording and documentation of children's progress through evidence
collection.
 While teachers should have autonomy in selecting assessment tools, systematic record-
keeping is crucial for professional responsibilities.
 Prioritize observation of children and analysis of their created artifacts as primary assessment
methods.
Preparatory Stage:

 Establish a robust system of formative assessment to track individual student progress as
formal learning commences across various subjects.
 Help students understand the competencies they are expected to achieve, facilitating their
understanding.
 Introduce formative oral and written assessments, alongside observation and artifact analysis,
to assess conceptual understanding and creativity.
 Conduct comprehensive summative assessments at the end of each year to ensure readiness
for the next grade, providing support options during breaks between grades.
Middle Stage:

 Maintain a competency-based assessment approach, covering all dimensions of learning,
particularly with the introduction of complex concepts.
 Shift emphasis towards conceptual understanding and higher-order capacities, utilizing various
assessment techniques like projects, debates, and presentations.

 Focus regular assessments on testing conceptual understanding and higher-order capacities,
encouraging creativity through appropriate questions.
 Conduct yearly comprehensive summative assessments, offering support options to ensure
readiness for the next grade.
Secondary Stage:

 Emphasize regular formative assessments to facilitate meaningful learning and constructive
feedback, especially considering the greater subject depth.
 Continue utilizing classroom assessments, with self-assessment playing a significant role in
student learning.
 Design assessments to evaluate competencies using diverse methods such as case-based
questions, simulations, and essay-type questions, fostering creativity.
 Utilize a variety of assessment methods, including written tests, practical tests, projects, and
open-book tests, with comprehensive summative assessments conducted at the end of each
year or term, often in the form of board examinations.
Additionally, implem ent Holistic Progress Cards (HPCs)  as formal communication tools between
schools and families, providing comprehensive reporting of students' progress based on
competencies and learning outcomes achieved. HPCs should focus on individual progress and
interests, providing disaggregated reporting to avoid comparisons with peers.  Detailed guidelines
and prototypes of HPC have been provided by CBSE for foundational classes.
