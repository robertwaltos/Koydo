 Technical Support
 1. How do I download the Course Media on the session pages? How do I know which version of the video to download?
 To download the Course Media, click on the media format icons or letters below the four Course Media options: Transcript, Audio, Low Bandwidth Video, and High Bandwidth Video. A box may pop up to confirm that you want to “Open” or “Save” the file; the prompt and terminology will differ depending on your choice of browser.
 The Transcript link will bring you to a Web page from which you can print a copy of the transcript by using the “Print” link in the upper-right corner of the page.
 The Audio link will download an mp3 file of the lecture to your device (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.) and can be played on any mp3 player.
 The Low Bandwidth Video (for slower Internet connections) and High Bandwidth Video (for high-speed Internet connections) links will download the lecture videos to your device and may be viewed at your convenience using the QuickTime Player (freely downloadable at  http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/ ).
 2. Why does my video stream buffer (look choppy or keep pausing)?
 The quality of your viewing experience will be affected by your Internet connection speed. Connection speed can vary at different times of the day; you may have better performance if you avoid high-traffic periods for your time zone. For optimal viewing of video files, you should use a high-speed connection such as DSL or cable modem.
 3. How do I view the closed captions on the videos?
 Closed captioning is available on the embedded video and the high-bandwidth QuickTime files located on the session pages of each course. To activate the closed captions, click the CC icon in the upper right corner of the embedded videos or bottom right corner of the downloaded QuickTime vidoes; click the CC icon again to turn off the captions.
 4. In some lectures, the professors refer to materials available on a Classes*v2 course site. How can I get a password to access Classes*v2?
 Classes*v2 is an on-campus website available to Yale students. In some Open Yale Courses, class handouts and other materials mentioned in the course lectures are posted in the “Resources” section of Open Yale Courses “session” pages. On occasion, materials have been omitted or edited due to copyright restrictions.
 5. Do I need specific software or information in order to view Open Yale Courses videos or resources?
 The embedded videos will play in your browser. The downloadable media files (audio .mp3, low-bandwidth .mov, and high-bandwidth .mov) can be played with QuickTime, iTunes,and VLC media players. When you click on one of these links, a new popup window will launch. Please check that your browser is not blocking popups.

 6. Why did I get the error message “File not found” or “This page cannot be found”?
 These error messages indicate a faulty link to a file or page. In some cases, particularly if you are using a bookmark or link from another website, this is because the page you are looking for has been moved or deleted; try using the navigation links or the “Search” box at the top of this website to locate the content you seek.
