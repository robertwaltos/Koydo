    Overview

         The ‘basic’ school curriculum includes the  ‘national curriculum’ , as well as  relationships, sex and health education, and religious education .

 The national curriculum is a set of subjects and standards used by  primary and secondary schools  so children learn the same things. It covers what subjects are taught and the standards children should reach in each subject.

 Other  types of school , like academies and private schools, do not have to follow the national curriculum. Academies must teach a broad and balanced curriculum including English, maths and science. They must also teach relationships and sex education, and religious education.

 Key stages

 The national curriculum is organised into blocks of years called ‘key stages’ (KS).

 Your child will be tested at the end of some key stages. The teacher will also assess your child’s performance during lessons throughout the year.
