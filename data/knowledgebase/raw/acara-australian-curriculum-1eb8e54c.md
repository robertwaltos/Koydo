     Changes to the Australian Curriculum review process to support teachers and students

 Ensuring Australian students develop the key knowledge, understanding and skills they need to be successful in life is at the heart of changes to the Australian Curriculum review cycle approved by all education ministers.

 On the advice of the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA), education ministers at their meeting on 17 October 2025 have approved:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Introducing an iterative review process</b>. Education ministers can direct ACARA to conduct iterative reviews of the Australian Curriculum during its implementation and use in schools to ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and current. The inclusion of an iterative review of the Australian Curriculum balances the need for stability of curriculum with the ability to respond rapidly when required.</li>\r\n<li><b>ACARA providing advice on an iterative review of Foundation to Year 2 Mathematics in the Australian Curriculum</b>. ACARA will work with jurisdictions, sectors and stakeholders to provide advice in February 2026 on whether changes are needed to the curriculum content in Mathematics for Foundation to Year 2, as well as to the way the content is sequenced. This is in light of NAPLAN results and the national focus on numeracy improvement, ahead of the Year 1 Numeracy Checks coming into effect later next year.</li>\r\n<li><b>The approval of the next version of the Australian Curriculum being scheduled for 2032</b>. The 10-year period recognises the extensive work each state and territory undertakes with teachers, principals, students and families to implement the Australian Curriculum in their context. The latest version, approved in 2022, is still in the process of being implemented in some states and territories, with full implementation expected in 2027.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Commenting on these changes, ACARA CEO, Stephen Gniel said:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“The Australian Curriculum is an explicit statement of the priorities and aspirations we hold for our young people. It makes clear to teachers and schools the key knowledge, understanding and skills our young people need to be successful in life, which is also at the heart of these changes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“The changes also reflect consultation with the education community, including teachers, principals and subject associations. They are in line with international best practice as seen in countries such as Finland and Japan, which are frequently cited in OECD research for their longer, stable curriculum cycles.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“The revised Australian Curriculum review process reflects the extensive work each state and territory undertakes with teachers and the wider school community to implement the Australian Curriculum in their local context. The iterative review process will mean that we can ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and responsive.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“ACARA will work with partners in the states and territories, and with other stakeholders, to explore whether changes are needed to the curriculum content in Mathematics for Foundation to Year 2, and explore whether additional support that provides greater specificity and clarity is needed to help teachers bring the subject to life in the classroom and improve outcomes.”</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For more information about these changes visit the <a href=\&#34;https://www.acara.edu.au/curriculum/curriculum-review\&#34;>ACARA website</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-320768287f" class="cmp-text ">

ACARA will work with jurisdictions, sectors and stakeholders to provide advice in February 2026 on whether changes are needed to the curriculum content in Mathematics for Foundation to Year 2, as well as to the way the content is sequenced. This is in light of NAPLAN results and the national focus on numeracy improvement, ahead of the Year 1 Numeracy Checks coming into effect later next year.
  The approval of the next version of the Australian Curriculum being scheduled for 2032 . The 10-year period recognises the extensive work each state and territory undertakes with teachers, principals, students and families to implement the Australian Curriculum in their context. The latest version, approved in 2022, is still in the process of being implemented in some states and territories, with full implementation expected in 2027.

 Commenting on these changes, ACARA CEO, Stephen Gniel said:

 “The Australian Curriculum is an explicit statement of the priorities and aspirations we hold for our young people. It makes clear to teachers and schools the key knowledge, understanding and skills our young people need to be successful in life, which is also at the heart of these changes.

 “The changes also reflect consultation with the education community, including teachers, principals and subject associations.

 “The revised Australian Curriculum review process reflects the extensive work each state and territory undertakes with teachers and the wider school community to implement the Australian Curriculum in their local context. The iterative review process will mean that we can ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and responsive.

 “ACARA will work with partners in the states and territories, and with other stakeholders, to explore whether changes are needed to the curriculum content in Mathematics for Foundation to Year 2, and explore whether additional support that provides greater specificity and clarity is needed to help teachers bring the subject to life in the classroom and improve outcomes.”
