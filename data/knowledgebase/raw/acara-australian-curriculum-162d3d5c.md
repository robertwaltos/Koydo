 The Australian Curriculum, Version 9.0 is a more stripped-back and teachable curriculum that identifies the essential content our children should learn.

 Overall, there’s a reduction in content, as well as better alignment between achievement standards and content descriptions, and improved links between learning areas and the general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities.

 Summary of key changes

  the removal and reduction of content so the curriculum can be taught with depth and rigour, including a 21% reduction in the number of content descriptions, which describe what is to be taught and what students are expected to learn
 a stronger focus on students mastering the essential mathematical facts, skills, concepts and processes, and being introduced to these at the right time
 making clear what mathematical computations need to be done without a calculator, reinforcing the importance of achieving proficiency in foundational skills
 a revision of the sequencing of content in Mathematics; in particular, telling time, introduction of fractions, recall of multiplication facts (“times tables’) and solving equations
 lifting standards for Mathematics in Year 1 in relation to addition and subtraction, with additional content setting expectations about recall and proficiency with multiplication facts, beginning in Year 2
 prioritising Australian history within a global context in Years 9 and 10
 deepening students’ understanding of First Nations Australian histories and cultures, the impact on - and perspectives of - First Nations Australians of the arrival of British settlers as well as their contribution to the building of modern Australia
 strengthening and making explicit teaching about the origins and Christian and Western heritage of Australia's democracy, as well as about the diversity of Australian communities
 strengthening the explicit teaching of consent and respectful relationships from F–10 in age-appropriate ways
 addition of privacy and security in the Digital Technologies curriculum
 strengthening the focus on students being physically active and increased content with a focus on activity in natural and outdoor settings.
 strengthening the Foundation year by identifying the essential content to teach in the first year of school across all 8 learning areas.

 ACARA is also undertaking further work in the important area of mental health for young Australians. This will be reflected in later updates to the Health and Physical Education curriculum.

     The Australian Curriculum – version history

In 2008, all governments agreed a national curriculum was needed to deliver an equitable, quality education for all young Australians and the national curriculum was then developed over a number of years. The national curriculum is reviewed every 6 years and the 2020– 2021 review resulted in the Australian Curriculum, Version 9.0.

 States and territories implement the Australian Curriculum according to their own timelines. Version 8.4 will remain available on the current Australian Curriculum website.

 During the transition period over the next few years, both Version 8.4 and Version 9.0 will be available.
