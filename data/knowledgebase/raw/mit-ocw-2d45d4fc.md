    In this course you will learn the basics of photography and gain an intriguing new perspective into the visual world. We will begin with a gentle introduction to the tools, and after that, we start in earnest.

 Although we will emphasize photographing science and engineering, most of the material will easily apply to other kinds of macro photography. The course&rsquo;s video tutorials will be accompanied by assignments using a camera, a flatbed scanner, and mobile devices. You will discover how subtle changes in lighting, composition, and background contribute to creating more effective images. You will also learn to think graphically and present your photographs for journal figures, covers, and grant submissions. We will also host interviews with notable image makers and art directors.
