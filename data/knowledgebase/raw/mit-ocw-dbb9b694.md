     Course Overview

 This course covers the analysis and design of digital integrated circuits using CMOS technology. The course emphasizes design, and requires extensive use of MAGIC for circuit layout, and HSPICE and IRSIM for simulations.

 Material is also derived from the  Journal of Solid-state Circuits  and the  International Solid-state Circuits Conference  proceedings.

     Prerequisites

 Basic device physics ( 6.012  or equivalent) and basic logic design ( 6.004  or equivalent).

     Grading

 There is a significant emphasis on the  design  aspect of the digital design process. The grade is based on problem sets, one design project, and two in-class quizzes. The final grade is calculated approximately using the following weights:

 Problem Sets (5) 20%

 Quiz #1 25%

 Quiz #2 25%

 Final Design Project 30%
