                 What is MIT OpenCourseWare?

                MIT OpenCourseWare is a free and open publication of material from thousands of MIT courses,
                covering the entire MIT curriculum and used by millions of learners and educators around the
                world.

                 Do I have to register or sign up?

                no signup, and no start or end dates.

                 Why is OCW made free to the public?
