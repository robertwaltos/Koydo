This is in light of NAPLAN results and the national focus on numeracy improvement, ahead of the Year 1 Numeracy Checks coming into effect later next year.\nThe approval of the next version of the Australian Curriculum being scheduled for 2032 . The 10-year period recognises the extensive work each state and territory undertakes with teachers, principals, students and families to implement the Australian Curriculum in their context. The latest version, approved in 2022, is still in the process of being implemented in some states and territories, with full implementation expected in 2027.\nCommenting on these changes, ACARA CEO, Stephen Gniel said:\n“The Australian Curriculum is an explicit statement of the priorities and aspirations we hold for our young people. It makes clear to teachers and schools the key knowledge, understanding and skills our young people need to be successful in life, which is also at the heart of these changes.\n“The changes also reflect consultation with the education community, including teachers, principals and subject associations.

The iterative review process will mean that we can ensure that the curriculum remains relevant and responsive.\n“ACARA will work with partners in the states and territories, and with other stakeholders, to explore whether changes are needed to the curriculum content in Mathematics for Foundation to Year 2, and explore whether additional support that provides greater specificity and clarity is needed to help teachers bring the subject to life in the classroom and improve outcomes.”\nFor more information about these changes visit the ACARA website .\nView all articles\nLatest\nChanges to the Australian Curriculum review process to support teachers and students\nF–10 curriculum</p>\n\"}}\" id=\"footer-menu-title-1\" class=\"cmp-text \">\nF–10 curriculum\nF–10 Curriculum overview\nLearning areas\nMachine-readable Australian Curriculum\nVers"}

Teachers are expected to ensure such an\natmosphere for students where they feel free to ask questions. They would promote active learning\namong students with a focus on reflections, connecting with the world around them, creating and\nconstructing knowledge.

Competency focussed learning\nunderscores the student’s demonstration of desired learning outcomes as central to the learning\nprocess. Learning outcomes are statements of expected outcomes that the student will be able to do\nto know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate after completion of a process of learning as a\nresult of learning the activity. Therefore, the focus is on measuring learning through attainment of\nprescribed learning outcomes.\nExperiential and active learning are the preferred pedagogies for Competency focussed Learning as\nthey promote critical thinking, creativity and effective study skills among students. Learning Outcomes\ndeveloped by NCERT for classes I -X that is enclosed with each subject should be adopted by all the\nschools and teaching-learning process may be accordingly aligned.

For example, Mathematical data handling and interpretation can be effectively\napplied in geography and science. Children can write better-framed answers in history, geography and\nscience when they have learnt how to write explanations/ short descriptions in a language. Similarly,\nLife Skills like empathy, problem solving and interpersonal communications can be easily integrated\nwith the study of literature and other areas. Universal Values, Life Skills and Constitutional Values with\nemphasis on realization of Fundamental Duties may be incorporated depending upon context in\nalmost all the subjects.\n2.8 Special Emphasis on Integrating Arts in Education\nAll disciplines being pursued by students at all stages requir e creative thinking and problem-solving\nabilities.

Art education continues to be an integral part of the curriculum. The schools may also\npromote and offer Visual and Performing Arts based subjects at the Secondary and Senior\nSecondary level.\nii. Art is also integrated with the te aching and learning process of all subjects from classes 1 to\n12, to promote active and experiential learning for “connecting knowledge to life outside the\nschool, ensuring that learning shifts away from rote methods and for enriching the curriculum,\nso that it goes beyond textbooks.”\n2.8.2 Art Integrated Pedagogy\nWhile preparing its annual pedagogical plan under the leadership of the Principal of the school, the\nschool must plan out in detail the Art Education to be imparted at various levels, and how that Art can\nbe integrated with classroom learning of various subjects.

It also informs\nthe individual learner about his/ her progress over a period of time enabling them to develop\nstrategies to improve learning.\n4.2.1 Periodic Assessment (05 Marks)\nThe main purpose of Periodic Assessment is to assess the learning progress of students. Such\nAssessment done at regular intervals provides feedback and insight to teachers regarding learners’\nneeds and helps them to improve instruction, do remedial teac hing and set curricular targets for a\nstudent or a group of students. The feedback also helps students to know their errors as well as\nstrengths and weaknesses. The students, thus, are enabled for better learning and setting up realistic\ngoals. In essence, this is assessment for, of and as learning. Periodic Assessment is further divided into\nthe following:\nPeriodic Tests (05 marks): As earlier, these would be restricted to 3 in each subject in a year and the\naverage of best 2 would to be taken for final submission of marks. These tests tend to follow a pattern,\nwhich is quite similar to the final end of course examination, and have a gradually increasing portion\nof content.

Subject\nteachers would determine the type and frequency. Schools/teachers would be able to use multiple\nand diverse assessment techniques to assess learners, i.e., observation, oral tests, individual or group\nwork, class discussion, field-work, concept maps, graphic organizers, visual representation etc. Hence,\nthe schools are given autonomy to use alternate modes of assessment as per the demand of the\nsubject and the context towards addressing the goal of assessment for and as learning, such as quizzes,\nproject-work, Self and peer assessment, collaborative projects, experiments, classroom\ndemonstrations, etc.\nCaution must be exercised to ensure that recording such a ssessment is not cumbersome and can be\neasily translated into individual student scores. When choosing a particular technique, developing\nsimple scoring criteria and rubrics becomes equally important. The purpose of periodic assessment is\n27\nto provide feedba ck to improve teaching and learning, so it is equally important to use follow -up\nmeasures when students are found to be lacking proficiency.\n4.2.3 Portfolio (05 marks):\nA port"}

As part of its conceptual, operational,\nand transactional approach to curriculum structure, pedagogy, time and content organisation, and the\noverall experience of the child, NCF-FS2022 emphasises the significance of \"play\" as the cornerstone\nof these concepts. Play, in addition to sports and games, also includes singing songs, conversations,\ntoys, stories, music, puzzles, rhymes, art and craft, painting, clay moulding, dancing, etc. Different\nchildren learn at different paces, and in different ways.

These screenings can be done by teachers, school psychologists, or\nother professionals using standardized assessment tools.\nTeacher observations: Teachers spend a significant amount of time with their students and are well-\npositioned to observe developmental delays. Teachers can use checklists or rating scales developed\nby World Health Organisation to track their students' developmental progress and identify areas\nwhere children may need additional support. NCERT’s PRASHAST is a checklist that enables the\nidentification of children at risk. It comprises two parts - for use by regular teachers for first -level\nscreening, and for use by spe cial educators and others for second -level screening.

School\nstaff should listen to parents' concerns and take appropriate action to assess and address any\ndevelopmental concerns.\nStandardized testing: Schools may administer standardized tests to ass ess academic skills, cognitive\nabilities, or social -emotional development. If a student performs significantly below their peers on\nthese assessments, it may indicate a developmental delay.\nThe framework also encourages teachers to work closely with parent s and caregivers to support\nchildren's learning and development.

Organisation of Time in the School\nThe National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage 2022 highlights the importance of careful\nplanning and organisation of time by allotting adequate and equitable time to all domains to achieve\nholistic education of children. Each activity may be planned to keep in mind the attention span of the\nchild. There may be a balance between child -initiated and Teacher -guided activities, group (whole\ngroup or small group) and individual or pair activities, and alternating activities (e.g., quieter activity\nafter physical activity, group activity after individual activity, indoor activity after outdoor activity). Art\nand Craft, Outdoor Play, and Free Play must have adequate time and focus during the day. Frequent\nbreaks and transitions may also be provided to allow children to regain their energy and interest.\nTo achieve this, the curriculum framework recomme nds a balanced distribution of time across\ndifferent areas of learning, such as language, mathematics, environmental studies, arts, and physical\neducation.

Events of the school\ne.g., duration of the school term, vacations, annual day, sp orts day, other school celebrations,\nexhibitions/field trips, parent -teacher meetings, teacher professional development programs, and\nschool meetings may be a part of this calendar.\nix. Culture of the Institution\nFundamentally, if children are loved and cared for, they will learn. Teachers should be kind and\ncompassionate. The school should be a safe space for all children. Children learn from their parents\n40\n(the mother being the first teacher), the teacher in the classroom and the environment around.\nTherefore, it is vital that the school works seamlessly with the parents and the community to provide\nmaximum learning opportunities for all children.\nx.

Her parents had started a skiing company, and the seasonal work meant that Gaul had to change schools every six months. Growing up in small towns in Australia and Canada, she relied on the internet to fuel her curiosity. “I went to 13 different schools, which was hard because you&rsquo;re in a different educational system every single time,” says Gaul. “That’s one of"}

Knowledge is something that exists beyond a curriculum.” The small towns she lived in often didn’t have a lot of resources, she says, so a computer served as a main tool for learning. She enjoyed engaging with Wikipedia, ultimately researching topics and writing and editing content for pages. In 2018, she discovered MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, and took her first course. OpenCouseWare offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 MIT undergraduate and graduate courses. “I really got started with the OpenCourseWare introductory electrical engineering classes, because I couldn’t find anything else quite like it online,” says Gaul, who was initially drawn to courses on circuits and electronics, such as 6.002 (Circuits and Electronics) and 6.01SC (Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). “It really helped me in terms of understanding how electrical engineering worked in a practical sense, and I just started modding things.” In true MIT “mens et manus” (“mind and hand”) fashion, Gaul spent much of her childhood building and inventing, especially when she wa"}

She says that a highlight was when she built a life-sized, working version of a Mario Kart, constructed out of materials she had printed. Gaul calls herself a “serial learner,” and has taken many OpenCourseWare courses. In addition to classes on circuits and electronics, she also took courses in linear algebra, calculus, and quantum physics — in which she took a particular interest. When she was 15, she participated in Qubit by Qubit. Hosted by The Coding School, in collaboration with universities (including MIT) and tech companies, this two-semester course introduces high schoolers to quantum computing and quantum physics. During that time she started a blog called On Zero, representing the “zero state” of a qubit. “The ‘zero state’ in a quantum computer is the representation of creativity from nothing, infinite possibilities,” says Gaul.

What she learned eventually led her to start asking questions such as “What is a hamiltonian?” and teaching quantum physics alongside PhDs. Building on these interests, Gaul chose to study quantum engineering at the University of New South Wales. She notes that on her first day of university, she participated in iQuHack, the MIT Quantum Hackathon. Her team worked to find a new way to approximate the value of a hyperbolic function using quantum logic, and received an honorable mention for “exceptional creativity.” Gaul’s passion for making things continued during her college days, especially in terms of innovating to solve a problem. When she found herself on a train, wanting to code a personal website on a computer with a dying battery, she wondered if there might be a way to make a glove that can act as a type of Bluetooth keyboard — essentially creating a way to type in the air. In her spare time, she started working on such a device, ultimately finding a less expensive way to build a lightweight, haptic, gesture-tracking glove with applications for virtual reality (VR) and robotics. Gaul says she has always had an interest in VR, using it to create her own worlds, reconstruct an old childhood house, and play Dungeons and Dragons with friends.

An early prototype that Gaul put together in her dorm room received a lot of attention on YouTube. She went on to win the People’s Choice award for it at the SxSW Sydney 2025 Tech and Innovation Festival. This design also sparked her co-founding of the tech startup On Zero, named after her childhood blog dedicated to the love of creation from nothing. Gaul sees the device, in general, as a way of “paying it forward,” making improved human-computer interaction available to many — from young students to professional technologists. She hopes to enable creative freedom in as many as she can. “The mind is just such a fun thing.

Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning Hinata Yamahara was 10 years old, on a family trip to Osaka, Japan, when he started riding the train alone. Those train rides sparked an interest in something he didn&rsquo;t have words for at the time — how cities are built, and how people navigate them. Now at 17 and applying to colleges, Yamahara has made the connection that investigating cities and how they work is a foundation for urban planning. MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, helped him develop knowledge and deepen his passion for walkable, community-oriented urban spaces. At the time of his first, fateful Osaka train ride, Yamahara lived in Atlanta, after having spent most of his elementary school years in rural Tennessee. Before that, he and his family had lived in Los Angeles. In all those places, he says, it was difficult for kids to get around. In fact, getting around without a car could be a challenge for anyone.

In fact, getting around without a car could be a challenge for anyone. Whenever he visited family in Japan, he was in awe of the efficiency of the train system and the ease of learning how to navigate it, in addition to the mixed-use buildings that combined commercial and residential spaces. As a 10-year-old, he simply thought they “were really cool” and quite different from what he saw at home. Now, he reflects on the efficient use of space in a country that is much smaller than the expansive United States. Back at home, Yamahara continued to reimagine the spaces around him, often printing out satellite imagery and drawing new possibilities over what existed. “Maybe instead of a giant parking lot, I’d draw a subway station and connect it to another part of the map,” he says. “But it was all imaginary. I didn’t know what was possible in terms of regulations or looking at past examples. So, I started to do research and kept coming across OpenCourseWare.” He remembers a moment of confusion, followed by one of excitement: “What is OpenCourseWare?” and, “Wait, everything is free!?” OpenCourseWare, an open publication of course materials from across the MIT curriculum, allows users to browse content at their own pace.

He has since accessed a variety of courses and counts 11.948 (Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development) and 11.304J (Site and Infrastructure Systems Planning) among the most memorable. Exploring OpenCourseWare resources gave him a strong foundation to take his interest in urban planning and redesign into the real world. In summer 2025, Yamahara completed an internship with an Atlanta-area real estate firm working on a redesign project with a city agency. “Right now, this city has a downtown area with a lot of parking lots and empty retail spaces. I’m getting to learn firsthand how to develop it into something else,” he explains. “I’m part of meetings where we brainstorm how to create a community feeling, how to make a space creative and walkable, and how to make it somewhere people really want to be.” According to Yamahara, the experience draws on his appreciation for Japanese efficiency, as well as American inclusivity and his deep knowledge of zoning regulations, community-centered design, and transit equity — all gained through Open"}

As Yamahara looks toward college and his future, he says he sees two paths influenced by MIT’s free educational resources. On one path, he studies urban planning, as OpenCourseWare materials have only reaffirmed his passion for the field and given him knowledge and confidence. On another path, he imagines using his time as an undergraduate to explore other interests, including aviation and real estate. On that path, OpenCourseWare would allow him to continue his urban planning education independently. He’s grateful that he could take advantage of OpenCourseWare resources without submitting an application and considering tuition and financial aid. All he needed was an interest and a determination to learn, and he had both. “OpenCourseWare has helped me grow from a kid with questions into a student designing solutions,” Yamahara says. “I still ride the train in the U.S. and Japan, but now, I bring a vision with me, too.” To explore additional lifelong learning offerings from MIT, visit MIT Learn.

Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning Mostafa Fawzy became interested in physics in high school. It was the “elegance and paradox” of quantum theory that got his attention and led to his studies at the undergraduate and graduate level. But even with a solid foundation of coursework and supportive mentors, Fawzy wanted more. MIT Open Learning’s OpenCourseWare was just the thing he was looking for. Now a doctoral candidate in atomic physics at Alexandria University and an assistant lecturer of physics at Alamein International University in Egypt, Fawzy reflects on how MIT OpenCourseWare bolstered his learning early in his graduate studies in 2019.

They enhanced both my theoretical insight and practical problem-solving skills — skills I later applied in research on atomic systems influenced by magnetic fields and plasma environments.” He completed educational resources including Quantum Physics I and Quantum Physics II, calling them “dense and mathematically sophisticated.” He met the challenge by engaging with the content in different ways: first, by simply listening to lectures, then by taking detailed notes, and finally by working though problem sets. Although initially he struggled to keep up, this methodical approach paid off, he says. Fawzy is now in the final stages of his doctoral research on high-precision atomic calculations under extreme conditions.

She has these amazing anecdotes related to what she’s explaining, and it really supplements my learning.” Although he says that math is not his strong suit, Tiwari has also been drawn into Gilbert Strang’s materials on MIT OpenCourseWare, particularly the class on different approaches to linear algebra. His own algebra class was just starting to study linear equations and matrices, so some of Strang’s material was difficult for Tiwari to understand. But it intrigued him enough to share the content with his teacher. “I told my teacher about the videos and that I learned that we could use matrices to find the intersection of linear equations way quicker than using substitution or elimination,” Tiwari explains. “He told me we would get to that eventually, so I kept watching. I’m not the best at math, but Professor Strang’s passion got to me.” As for Tiwari’s passion, it lies in biology and chemistry, specifically neurology and how diseases affect the human brain.

Purpose in adversity Soon after relocating to Egypt, Eldouma lost her job and found herself struggling to find purpose in the life circumstances she had been handed. Due to visa restrictions, challenges getting right-to-work permits, and a complicated employment market in Egypt, she was also unable to find a new job. “I was sort of in a depressive episode, because of all that was happening,” she reflects. “It just hit me that I lost everything that I know, everything that I love.

For MIT OpenCourseWare’s PDF content available through the ULTA program, they created a specialized tool that uses optical character recognition to recognize LaTeX in documents — such as problem sets and other materials — and then used a few large language models to translate them, all while maintaining technical accuracy. The team built a glossary of technical terms used in the courses and their corresponding Ukrainian translations, to help make sure that the wording was correct and consistent. Each translation also undergoes human review to further ensure accuracy and high quality.

That experience was transformative, says Trišović, who is now a research scientist at the FutureTech lab within MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “That course changed my life,” she says. “Throughout my career, I have considered myself a Python coder, and MIT OpenCourseWare made it possible. I was in my hometown on another continent, learning from MIT world-class resources. When I reflect on my path, it’s incredible.” Over time, Trišović&rsquo;s path led her to explore a range of OpenCourseWare resources. She recalls that, as a non-native English speaker, some of the materials were challenging. But thanks to the variety of courses and learning opportunities available on OpenCourseWare, she was always able to find ones that suited her. She encourages anyone facing that same challenge to be persist"}

She has also done research at the University of Chicago and Harvard University. “I like that computer science allows me to make an impact in a range of fields, but physics remains close to my heart, and I’m constantly inspired by it,” she says. MIT FutureTech, an interdisciplinary research group, draws on computer science, economics, and management to identify computing trends that create risk and opportunities for sustainable economic growth. There, Trišović studies the democratization of AI, including the implications of open-source AI and how that will impact science.

It’s an endeavor to make sense of the world and myself.” After acquiring some dance-related injuries, Adams returned to psychology. She completed an online certificate program specializing in medical neuroscience via Duke University, focusing on how pathology arises out of the way the brain computes information and generates behavior.

She discovered a passion for software while working on a dashboard design project, and decided to pivot from hardware to software engineering. That’s when she discovered Senga Technologies, a logistics software and services company in Kenya catering to businesses that ship in Africa. Odongo founded Senga with the goal of simplifying and easing the supply chain and logistics experience, from the movement of goods to software tools. Senga’s ultimate goal, Odongo says, is to have most of their services driven by software. That means employees — and candidates — need to be able to think through complex problems using computer science theory. “A lot of people are focused on programming, but we care less about programming and more about problem-solving,” says Odongo, who received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and an MBA from Harvard Business School. “We actually apply the things people learn in computer science programs.” Wacheke started the bridging course in June 2022 and was given six"}

A love of flight and a drive to excel Henshall first discovered OCW as she was pursuing her master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. Transitioning from an applied engineering program at the United States Air Force Academy to a more theoretical program proved a challenge for Henshall, and her first semester grades got her put on academic probation. During Independent Activities Period, she took Professor Gilbert Strang’s linear algebra courses on OCW, which included both videos and homework.

That early love of outer space and building things led her to a bachelor’s degree in astronautical engineering and the Air Force. There she served as a research and development officer, instructor pilot, and chief financial officer of her squadron. But a non-combat-related injury forced her to medically retire from being a pilot. “I was not doing well physically, and it was impossible for me to get hired to be a pilot outside of the Air Force.” After a brief detour as a part-time aerial circus performer, she decided to go back to school.

She attended Auburn University for her second master’s degree (this time in computer science and software engineering) and started a PhD. Again she turned to MIT OCW to supplement her studies. Henshall says, “I remembered vividly how much it had helped me in 2005, so of course that’s where I was going to start. Then I noticed that OCW linked to MITx, which had more interactive quizzes.” The OCW platform had also become more robust since she had first used it. “Back then, it was new, there wasn’t necessarily a standard,” she says. Over 10 years later, she found that most courses had more material, videos, and notes that more closely approximated an MIT course experience. Those additional open education resources gave Henshall an extra edge to complete a 21-month program in 12 months with a 4.0 GPA.

But with the guidance of lectures, slides, and other freely available resources on MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW), they soon advanced onto multivariable calculus. Then differential equations. Then linear algebra. Today, the students, who call their study group İleri Çalışmalar, or “Advanced Studies,” are paving their own road toward doctoral-level studies — with MIT OCW as their main resource. “Our motivation is to create a theoretical background in order to do research while we’re studying in medical school,” says Yıldırım Adalıoğlu, one of the study group’s co-founders, who explains that MD-PhD programs, which prepare students to become both clinicians and researchers, have only recently become available in Turkey, and are rare. “We didn’t have the chance to do doctoral-level research during medical school.

The study group devotes about three months — the equivalent of an MIT semester — to each course in their curriculum. While most of their peers are on the clinician path, the group co-founded by Sıla Özkal, Begüm Tahhan, and Çağan Kaplan typically draws six to 10 students per course. Support and collaboration to pursue focused interests Depending on their schedule, Kaplan explains, the students meet weekly to discuss the OCW lectures and to review course materials. At each meeting, one or more members of the group volunteer to recap the lectures and to facilitate discussion. For new courses — like probability, the group’s current focus — the students approach discussion sessions collaboratively. “After nearly two years of medical coursework,” Adalıoğlu says, “we can now teach and adapt the earlier courses for new students as well.” The group also brainstorms potential research projects, some of which they have already carried out, independently and in collaboration with faculty from other departments and labs.

The internship called for a background in computational research and data analysis. Thanks to MIT OCW, the İleri Çalışmalar students were well-prepared, says Adalıoğlu. “If we didn’t have the Python course from MIT, then we couldn’t go to the lab and do the internship there.” Combining their medical interests with their OCW coursework, Adalıoğlu and Kaplan also developed a computational model to study the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. They’re now in the process of trying to publish their findings. “OCW broadens our horizons,” Kaplan says. Adalıoğlu adds, “If we want to do computational research, it’s mainly up to us.

Özkal, who attends a cancer research internship, also credits the OCW courses that İleri Çalışmalar has covered with advancing her research goals. The tool kits to build their own future Currently in their third and fourth years of medical school, the İleri Çalışmalar founders note that OpenCourseWare has been a useful supplement to their medical studies as well. While studying the human gastrointestinal system, for example, they revisited the biological chemistry course materials to better understand the biochemical pathways that lead to absorption. “When we are confused about any subject, we can always go back to OCW and search for the slides,” says Kaplan. “We all want to do novel research and study the topics that allow people to understand our universe better.

Fresh out of university, he was there to teach computer skills and graphic design — some of his students included members of the new country’s government — but his time in South Sudan quickly became a learning experience for him, too. “When you grow up in your community, you have this bubble. We all experience it — it’s a human thing,” he reflects. “For the first time, I realized that everything I knew is not a given. Everything I grew up knowing is not universal.” With his worldview newly broadened, he began to nurture his interest in psychology, philosophy, and the sciences, watching crash courses, explainer videos, and other content on the subject. “It’s entertainment, to me, at the same time that it’s a passion,” he says.

Guerrero appreciates that OpenCourseWare dives deep into specific topics through an assortment of quizzes, exams, lecture notes, and videos. “It does challenge you to learn the concept, while at the same time, retaining it much better,” says Guerrero. MIT’s approach is different from how he first learned these concepts as an undergraduate — which he describes as “brute force memorization.” In one OpenCourseWare biology course lecture, for example, Guerrero studied a diagram of a cell that traced the path from nucleus to DNA. During a later assignment about protein production, he made the connection, “Oh, it goes by path. It’s organized,” he says. This holistic approach to learning helped strengthen his understanding of the concept. Guerrero also appreciates the platform’s flexibility, allowing him to learn on his own schedule. “What truly sets OpenCourseWare apart is its commitment to accessibility,” Guerrero says. “Not every student needs to be enrolled in a program and OpenCourseWare has made that possible.

This is particularly important for community colleges, like Pasadena City College, participating in California’s Zero Textbook Cost Program. The strength of OpenCourseWare for educators and students, Guerrero says, is that “people know it’s coming from a reliable, verified source — coming from MIT.” Researching medical applications After three decades in the biotech industry with roles ranging from research and development, to production, to quality assurance, Guerrero aspires to return to DNA research. He hopes to use advanced technologies that weren’t available during his previous time in the field — such as Next Generation Sequencing and CRISPR — to develop new medical applications. He aims to transform theoretical concepts into practical treatments for curing diseases and other conditions. “I’ve always thought about that aspect of helping someone with the technology made available,” he says. “However, I would prefer to remain in an academic environment until I have developed a comprehensive understanding of these technologies, as well as a solid foundation in genetics, which I believe is essential for ef"}

Knowledge is something that exists beyond a curriculum.” The small towns she lived in often didn’t have a lot of resources, she says, so a computer served as a main tool for learning. She enjoyed engaging with Wikipedia, ultimately researching topics and writing and editing content for pages. In 2018, she discovered MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, and took her first course. OpenCouseWare offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 MIT undergraduate and graduate courses. “I really got started with the OpenCourseWare introductory electrical engineering classes, because I couldn’t find anything else quite like it online,” says Gaul, who was initially drawn to courses on circuits and electronics, such as 6.002 (Circuits and Electronics) and 6.01SC (Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science). “It really helped me in terms of understanding how electrical engineering worked in a practical sense, and I just started mod"}

She says that a highlight was when she built a life-sized, working version of a Mario Kart, constructed out of materials she had printed. Gaul calls herself a “serial learner,” and has taken many OpenCourseWare courses. In addition to classes on circuits and electronics, she also took courses in linear algebra, calculus, and quantum physics — in which she took a particular interest. When she was 15, she participated in Qubit by Qubit. Hosted by The Coding School, in collaboration with universities (including MIT) and tech companies, this two-semester course introduces high schoolers to quantum computing and quantum physics. During that time she started a blog called On Zero, representing the “zero state” of a qubit. “The ‘zero state’ in a quantum computer is the representation of creativity from nothing, infinite possibilities,” says Gaul.

What she learned eventually led her to start asking questions such as “What is a hamiltonian?” and teaching quantum physics alongside PhDs. Building on these interests, Gaul chose to study quantum engineering at the University of New South Wales. She notes that on her first day of university, she participated in iQuHack, the MIT Quantum Hackathon. Her team worked to find a new way to approximate the value of a hyperbolic function using quantum logic, and received an honorable mention for “exceptional creativity.” Gaul’s passion for making things continued during her college days, especially in terms of innovating to solve a problem. When she found herself on a train, wanting to code a personal website on a computer with a dying battery, she wondered if there might be a way to make a glove that can act as a type of Bluetooth keyboard — essentially creating a way to type in the air. In her spare time, she started working on such a device, ultimately finding a less expensive way to build a lightweight, haptic, gesture-tracking glove with applications for virtual reality (VR) and robotics.

She discovered a way to put into a glove some small linear resonant actuators, which can be found in a smartphone or gaming controller, and map to any object in VR so that the user can feel it. An early prototype that Gaul put together in her dorm room received a lot of attention on YouTube. She went on to win the People’s Choice award for it at the SxSW Sydney 2025 Tech and Innovation Festival. This design also sparked her co-founding of the tech startup On Zero, named after her childhood blog dedicated to the love of creation from nothing.

Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning Hinata Yamahara was 10 years old, on a family trip to Osaka, Japan, when he started riding the train alone. Those train rides sparked an interest in something he didn&rsquo;t have words for at the time — how cities are built, and how people navigate them. Now at 17 and applying to colleges, Yamahara has made the connection that investigating cities and how they work is a foundation for urban planning. MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, helped him develop knowledge and deepen his passion for walkable, community-oriented urban spaces. At the time of his first, fateful Osaka train ride, Yamahara lived in Atlanta, after having spent most of his elementary school years in rural Tennessee. Before that, he and his family had lived in Los Angeles. In all those places, he says, it was difficult for kids to get aro"}

Before that, he and his family had lived in Los Angeles. In all those places, he says, it was difficult for kids to get around. In fact, getting around without a car could be a challenge for anyone. Whenever he visited family in Japan, he was in awe of the efficiency of the train system and the ease of learning how to navigate it, in addition to the mixed-use buildings that combined commercial and residential spaces. As a 10-year-old, he simply thought they “were really cool” and quite different from what he saw at home. Now, he reflects on the efficient use of space in a country that is much smaller than the expansive United States. Back at home, Yamahara continued to reimagine the spaces around him, often printing out satellite imagery and drawing new possibilities over what existed. “Maybe instead of a giant parking lot, I’d draw a subway station and connect it to another part of the map,” he says. “But it was all imaginary. I didn’t know what was possible in terms of regulations or looking at past examples. So, I started to do research and kept coming across OpenCourseWare.” He remembers a moment of confusion, followed by one of excitement: “What is OpenCourseWare?” and, “Wait, everything is free!?” OpenCourseWare, an open publication of course materials from across the MIT curriculum, allows users"}

He has since accessed a variety of courses and counts 11.948 (Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development) and 11.304J (Site and Infrastructure Systems Planning) among the most memorable. Exploring OpenCourseWare resources gave him a strong foundation to take his interest in urban planning and redesign into the real world. In summer 2025, Yamahara completed an internship with an Atlanta-area real estate firm working on a redesign project with a city agency. “Right now, this city has a downtown area with a lot of parking lots and empty retail spaces. I’m getting to learn firsthand how to develop it into something else,” he explains. “I’m part of meetings where we brainstorm how to create a community feeling, how to make a space creative and walkable, and how to make it somewhere people really want to be.” According to Yamahara, the experience draws on his appreciation for Japanese efficiency, a"}

As Yamahara looks toward college and his future, he says he sees two paths influenced by MIT’s free educational resources. On one path, he studies urban planning, as OpenCourseWare materials have only reaffirmed his passion for the field and given him knowledge and confidence. On another path, he imagines using his time as an undergraduate to explore other interests, including aviation and real estate. On that path, OpenCourseWare would allow him to continue his urban planning education independently. He’s grateful that he could take advantage of OpenCourseWare resources without submitting an application and considering tuition and financial aid. All he needed was an interest and a determination to learn, and he had both. “OpenCourseWare has helped me grow from a kid with questions into a student designing solutions,” Yamahara says. “I still ride the train in the U.S. and Japan, but now, I bring a vision with me, too.” To explore additional lifelong learning offerings from MIT, visit MIT Learn.

They enhanced both my theoretical insight and practical problem-solving skills — skills I later applied in research on atomic systems influenced by magnetic fields and plasma environments.” He completed educational resources including Quantum Physics I and Quantum Physics II, calling them “dense and mathematically sophisticated.” He met the challenge by engaging with the content in different ways: first, by simply listening to lectures, then by taking detailed notes, and finally by working though problem sets. Although initially he struggled to keep up, this methodical approach paid off, he says.

Is there a half-hour before bed to watch a video, or some time on the weekend to read lecture notes? If you figure out how to make it work for you, it is definitely worth the effort.” “If you do that, you are going to grow academically and personally,” Solano says. “When you go to school, you will feel more confident.” And Solano is not slowing down. She plans to continue using Open Learning resources, this time turning her attention to graduate-level courses, all in service of her curiosity and drive for knowledge. “When I was younger, I read the book &lsquo;The God Equation,&rsquo; by Michio Kaku, which explains quantum gravity theory.

Carolyn Tiernan | MIT Open Learning Sujood Eldouma always knew she loved math; she just didn’t know how to use it for good in the world. But after a personal and educational journey that took her from Sudan to Cairo to London, all while leveraging MIT Open Learning’s online educational resources, she finally knows the answer: data science. An early love of data Eldouma grew up in Omdurman, Sudan, with her parents and siblings. She always had an affinity for STEM subjects, and at the University of Khartoum she majored in electrical and electronic engineering with a focus in control and instrumentation engineering.

While Eldouma loves math, she always wanted to find ways to use it for good. Through the early exposure to data science and statistical methods at her university, she saw how data science leverages math for real-world impact. After graduation, she took a job at the DAL Group, the largest Sudanese conglomerate, where she helped to incorporate data science and new technologies to automate processes within the company. When civil war erupted in Sudan in April 2023, life as Eldouma knew it was turned upside down, and her family was forced to make the difficult choice to relocate to Egypt. Purpose in adversity Soon after relocating to Egypt, Eldouma lost her job and found herself struggling to find purpose in the life circumstances she had been handed. Due to visa restrictions, challenges getting right-to-work permits, and a complicated employment market in Egypt, she was also unable to find a new job. “I was sort of in a depressive episode, because of all that was happening,” she reflects. “It just hit me that I lost e"}

By Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning Bernardo Picão has been interested in online learning since the early days of YouTube, when his father showed him a TED Talk. But it was with MIT Open Learning that he realized just how transformational digital resources can be. “YouTube was my first introduction to the idea that you can actually learn stuff via the internet,” Picão says. “So, when I became interested in mathematics and physics when I was 15 or 16, I turned to the internet and stumbled upon some playlists from MIT OpenCourseWare and went from there.” OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, offers free online educational resources from over 2,500 MIT undergraduate and graduate courses. Since discovering it, Picão has explored linear algebra with Gilbert Strang, professor emeritus of mathematics — whom Picão calls “a legend” — and courses on metaphysics, functional analysis, quantum field theory, and English.

Stefanie Koperniak | MIT Open Learning Bia Adams, a London-based neuropsychologist, former professional ballet dancer, and MIT Open Learning learner, has built her career across decades of diverse, interconnected experiences and an emphasis on lifelong learning. She earned her bachelor’s degree in clinical and behavioral psychology, and then worked as a psychologist and therapist for several years before taking a sabbatical in her late 20s to study at the London Contemporary Dance School and The Royal Ballet — fulfilling a long-time dream. “In hindsight, I think what drew me most to ballet was not so much the form itself,” says Adams, “but more of a subconscious desire to make sense of my body moving through space and time, my emotions and motivations — all within a discipline that is rigorous, meticulous, and routine-based. It’s an endeavor to make sense of the world and myself.” After acquiring some dance-related injuries, Adams returned to psychology.

She further enhanced her understanding of AI with the Minds and Machines course on MITx Online, part of Open Learning. Adams is now in the process of completing Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, taught by John Guttag; Eric Grimson, former interim vice president for Open Learning; and Ana Bell. “I am multilingual, and I think the way my brain processes code is similar to the way computers code,” says Adams. “I find learning to code similar to learning a foreign language: both exhilarating and intimidating. Learning the rules, deciphering the syntax, and building my own world through code is one of the most fascinating challenges of my life.” Adams is also pursuing a master’s degree at Duke and the University College of London, focusing on the neurobiology of sleep and looking particularly at how the biochemistry of the brain can affect this critical function.

By Sara Feijo | MIT Open Learning When June Odongo interviewed early-career electrical engineer Cynthia Wacheke for a software engineering position at her company, Wacheke lacked knowledge of computer science theory but showed potential in complex problem-solving. Determined to give Wacheke a shot, Odongo turned to MIT OpenCourseWare to create a six-month “bridging course” modeled after the classes she once took as a computer science student. Part of MIT Open Learning, OpenCourseWare offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 courses that span the MIT undergraduate and graduate curriculum. “Wacheke had the potential and interest to do the work that needed to be done, so the way to solve this was for me to literally create a path for her to get that work done,” says Odongo, founder and CEO of Senga Technologies.

She has done so much in such a short time.” Making high-quality candidates job-ready Wacheke, who holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nairobi, started her professional career as a hardware engineer. She discovered a passion for software while working on a dashboard design project, and decided to pivot from hardware to software engineering. That’s when she discovered Senga Technologies, a logistics software and services company in Kenya catering to businesses that ship in Africa. Odongo founded Senga with the goal of simplifying and easing the supply chain and logistics experience, from the movement of goods to software tools. Senga’s ultimate goal, Odongo says, is to have most of their services driven by software. That means employees — and candidates — need to be able to think through complex problems using computer science theory. “A lot of people are focused on programming, but we care less about programming and more about problem-solving,” says Odongo, who received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and an MBA from Harvard Business S"}

She took nine courses, including: Introduction to Algorithms; Mathematics for Computer Science; Design and Analysis of Algorithms; Elements of Software Construction; Automata, Computability, and Complexity; Database Systems; Principles of Autonomy and Decision Making; Introduction to Machine Learning; and Networks. “The bridging course helped me learn how to think through things,” Wacheke says. “It’s one thing to know how to do something, but it’s another to design that thing from scratch and implement it.” During the bridging course, Wacheke was paired with a software engineer at Senga, who mentored her and answered questions along the way. She learned Ruby on Rails, a server-side web application framework under the MIT License. Wacheke also completed other projects to complement the theory she was learning.

A love of flight and a drive to excel Henshall first discovered OCW as she was pursuing her master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. Transitioning from an applied engineering program at the United States Air Force Academy to a more theoretical program proved a challenge for Henshall, and her first semester grades got her put on academic probation.

She was able to lift her grades the following semester, and by the end of her program, she was getting all A’s. Henshall says, “OpenCourseWare really saved me. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to complete my master’s.” Ever since Henshall learned the term “astronautical engineer” in the fourth grade, she knew what she wanted to be when she grew up. That early love of outer space and building things led her to a bachelor’s degree in astronautical engineering and the Air Force. There she served as a research and development officer, instructor pilot, and chief financial officer of her squadron. But a non-combat-related injury forced her to medically retire from being a pilot. “I was not doing well physically, and it was impossible for me to get hired to be a pilot outside of the Air Force.” After a brief detour as a part-time aerial circus performer, she decided to go back to school.

She attended Auburn University for her second master’s degree (this time in computer science and software engineering) and started a PhD. Again she turned to MIT OCW to supplement her studies. Henshall says, “I remembered vividly how much it had helped me in 2005, so of course that’s where I was going to start. Then I noticed that OCW linked to MITx, which had more interactive quizzes.” The OCW platform had also become more robust since she had first used it. “Back then, it was new, there wasn’t necessarily a standard,” she says. Over 10 years later, she found that most courses had more material, videos, and notes that more closely approximated an MIT course experience. Those additional open education resources gave Henshall an extra edge to complete a 21-month program in 12 months with a 4.0 GPA.

Her work with unmanned aerial vehicles (a.k.a. drones) uses a small quadrotor to autonomously and quickly search a building using reinforcement learning. The primary intended use is search and rescue. The second project involves research into multi-agent reinforcement learning and pathfinding.

By Duyen Nguyen | MIT Open Learning About two years ago, a group of medical students at Ege University Faculty of Medicine in Turkey began meeting to study single variable calculus. None of the students had taken a course in this subject before. But with the guidance of lectures, slides, and other freely available resources on MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW), they soon advanced onto multivariable calculus. Then differential equations. Then linear algebra. Today, the students, who call their study group İleri Çalışmalar, or “Advanced Studies,” are paving their own road toward doctoral-level studies — with MIT OCW as their main resource. “Our motivation is to create a theoretical background in order to do research while we’re studying in medical school,” says Yıldırım Adalıoğlu, one of the study group’s co-founders, who explains that MD-PhD programs, which prepare students to become both clinicians and researchers, have only recently become available in Turkey, and are rare. “We didn’t have the chance to do doctoral-"}

We decided to create that for ourselves.” Using OCW courses to build their own curriculum, the members of İleri Çalışmalar have developed an independent program of study while working toward their medical degrees. The study group devotes about three months — the equivalent of an MIT semester — to each course in their curriculum. While most of their peers are on the clinician path, the group co-founded by Sıla Özkal, Begüm Tahhan, and Çağan Kaplan typically draws six to 10 students per course. Support and collaboration to pursue focused interests Depending on their schedule, Kaplan explains, the students meet weekly to discuss the OCW lectures and to review course materials. At each meeting, one or more members of the group volunteer to recap the lectures and to facilitate discussion. For new courses — like probability, the group’s current focus — the students approach discussion sessions collaboratively. “After nearly two years of medical coursework,” Adalıoğlu says, “we can now teach and adapt the earlier courses for new students as well.” The group also brainstorms potential research projects, some of which they have already carried out, inde"}

They drew on the knowledge they gained from classes 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python) and 6.0002 (Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science) to work on a study on analyzing the effects of mutations in a specific protein. The internship called for a background in computational research and data analysis. Thanks to MIT OCW, the İleri Çalışmalar students were well-prepared, says Adalıoğlu. “If we didn’t have the Python course from MIT, then we couldn’t go to the lab and do the internship there.” Combining their medical interests with their OCW coursework, Adalıoğlu and Kaplan also developed a computational model to study the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany. They’re now in the process of trying to publish their findings. “OCW broadens our horizons,” Kaplan says. Adalıoğlu adds, “If we want to do computational research, it’s mainly up to us.

Nurturing a worldview In 2014 Kasigazi moved to South Sudan, which had only recently emerged from a civil war as an independent nation. Fresh out of university, he was there to teach computer skills and graphic design — some of his students included members of the new country’s government — but his time in South Sudan quickly became a learning experience for him, too. “When you grow up in your community, you have this bubble. We all experience it — it’s a human thing,” he reflects. “For the first time, I realized that everything I knew is not a given. Everything I grew up knowing is not universal.” With his worldview newly broadened, he began to nurture his interest in psychology, philosophy, and the sciences, watching crash courses, explainer videos, and other content on the subject. “It’s entertainment, to me, at the same time that it’s a passion,” he says.

Guerrero received a degree in biology from University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 1992, and joined the workforce of thousands of sequencers mapping DNA. However, six years after leaving his job as a sequencing associate at Incyte, a lecturer at UC Berkeley informed Guerrero that the technology used to sequence the human genome had already become obsolete. “This stark contrast highlights the rapid pace of technological evolution in this field,” says Guerrero. “Motivated by this insight, I decided to return to school, starting with a course in genetics.” That’s when Guerrero enrolled as a part-time student at Pasadena City College in Los Angeles in 2016. Since then, he continues to deepen his knowledge with MIT Open Learning educational resources. “I decided to update my skills in the sciences because they change rapidly,” says Guerrero.

Guerrero appreciates that OpenCourseWare dives deep into specific topics through an assortment of quizzes, exams, lecture notes, and videos. “It does challenge you to learn the concept, while at the same time, retaining it much better,” says Guerrero. MIT’s approach is different from how he first learned these concepts as an undergraduate — which he describes as “brute force memorization.” In one OpenCourseWare biology course lecture, for example, Guerrero studied a diagram of a cell that traced the path from nucleus to DNA. During a later assignment about protein production, he made the connection, “Oh, it goes by path. It’s organized,” he says. This holistic approach to learning helped strengthen his understanding of the concept.

This is particularly important for community colleges, like Pasadena City College, participating in California’s Zero Textbook Cost Program. The strength of OpenCourseWare for educators and students, Guerrero says, is that “people know it’s coming from a reliable, verified source — coming from MIT.” Researching medical applications After three decades in the biotech industry with roles ranging from research and development, to production, to quality assurance, Guerrero aspires to return to DNA research. He hopes to use advanced technologies that weren’t available during his previous time in the field — such as Next Generation Sequencing and CRISPR — to develop new medical applications.

Growing up in small towns in Australia and Canada, she relied on the internet to fuel her curiosity. “I went to 13 different schools, which was hard because you&rsquo;re in a different educational system every single time,” says Gaul. “That’s one of the reasons I gravitated toward online learning and teaching myself. Knowledge is something that exists beyond a curriculum.” The small towns she lived in often didn’t have a lot of resources, she says, so a computer served as a main tool for learning. She enjoyed engaging with Wikipedia, ultimately researching topics and writing and editing content for pages. In 2018, she discovered MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, and took her first course. OpenCouseWare offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 MIT undergraduate and graduate courses. “I really got started with the OpenCourseWare introductory electrical engineering classes, because I couldn’t find anything else quite like it online,” says Gaul, who was initially drawn to courses on circuits and electronics, such as 6.002 (Circuits and Electronics) and 6.01SC (Introduction to Electrical Engineering"}

She says that a highlight was when she built a life-sized, working version of a Mario Kart, constructed out of materials she had printed. Gaul calls herself a “serial learner,” and has taken many OpenCourseWare courses. In addition to classes on circuits and electronics, she also took courses in linear algebra, calculus, and quantum physics — in which she took a particular interest. When she was 15, she participated in Qubit by Qubit. Hosted by The Coding School, in collaboration with universities (including MIT) and tech companies, this two-semester course introduces high schoolers to quantum computing and quantum physics.

What she learned eventually led her to start asking questions such as “What is a hamiltonian?” and teaching quantum physics alongside PhDs. Building on these interests, Gaul chose to study quantum engineering at the University of New South Wales. She notes that on her first day of university, she participated in iQuHack, the MIT Quantum Hackathon. Her team worked to find a new way to approximate the value of a hyperbolic function using quantum logic, and received an honorable mention for “exceptional creativity.” Gaul’s passion for making things continued during her college days, especially in terms of innovating to solve a problem.

She discovered a way to put into a glove some small linear resonant actuators, which can be found in a smartphone or gaming controller, and map to any object in VR so that the user can feel it. An early prototype that Gaul put together in her dorm room received a lot of attention on YouTube.

At the time of his first, fateful Osaka train ride, Yamahara lived in Atlanta, after having spent most of his elementary school years in rural Tennessee. Before that, he and his family had lived in Los Angeles. In all those places, he says, it was difficult for kids to get around. In fact, getting around without a car could be a challenge for anyone. Whenever he visited family in Japan, he was in awe of the efficiency of the train system and the ease of learning how to navigate it, in addition to the mixed-use buildings that combined commercial and residential spaces. As a 10-year-old, he simply thought they “were really cool” and quite different from what he saw at home. Now, he reflects on the efficient use of space in a country that is much smaller than the expansive United States. Back at home, Yamahara continued to reimagine the spaces around him, often printing out satellite imagery and drawing new possibilities over what existed. “Maybe instead of a giant parking lot, I’d draw a subway station and connect it to another part of the map,” he says. “But it was all imaginary. I didn’t know what was possible in terms of regulations or looking at past examples. So, I started to do research and kept coming across OpenCourseWare.” He remembers a moment of confusion, followed by one of excitement: “What is Ope"}

So, I started to do research and kept coming across OpenCourseWare.” He remembers a moment of confusion, followed by one of excitement: “What is OpenCourseWare?” and, “Wait, everything is free!?” OpenCourseWare, an open publication of course materials from across the MIT curriculum, allows users to browse content at their own pace. Learners can watch video lectures, read course notes, and hear from faculty experts, with no enrollment fees or start dates. Yamahara dove into the content, starting with 11.001J (Introduction to Urban Design and Development). He has since accessed a variety of courses and counts 11.948 (Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development) and 11.304J (Site and Infrastructure Systems Planning) among the most memorable. Exploring OpenCourseWare resources gave him a strong foundation to take his interest in urban planning and redesign into the real world. In summer 2025, Yamahara completed an internship with an Atlanta-area real estate firm working on a redesign project with a city agency. “Right now, this city has a downtown area with a lot of parking lots and empty retail spaces. I’m getting to learn firsthand how to develop it into something else,” he explains. “I’m part of meetings where we brainstorm how to create a community feeling, how to make a space creative and walkable"}

As Yamahara looks toward college and his future, he says he sees two paths influenced by MIT’s free educational resources. On one path, he studies urban planning, as OpenCourseWare materials have only reaffirmed his passion for the field and given him knowledge and confidence. On another path, he imagines using his time as an undergraduate to explore other interests, including aviation and real estate. On that path, OpenCourseWare would allow him to continue his urban planning education independently. He’s grateful that he could take advantage of OpenCourseWare resources without submitting an application and considering tuition and financial aid. All he needed was an interest and a determination to learn, and he had both. “OpenCourseWare has helped me grow from a kid with questions into a student designing solutions,” Yamahara says. “I still ride the train"}

Years later, when he was working on another book, “Managing by Creativity,” he revisited MIT and discovered OpenCourseWare. “When I found OpenCourseWare, I was immediately drawn to the quality, openness, and academic rigor of the platform,” he recalls. “I continue to consult OpenCourseWare regularly and receive its newsletter to this day, at the age of 80 years old.” He views open education resources as a beacon, saying that they can be a “vital gateway” for learners who may not otherwise have access to educational materials or the ability to travel. Courses on project management, leadership, organizational behavior, creativity, entrepreneurship, and generative AI have aided Al-Hassanieh in his research and teaching over the years. He stresses that it is not just the course content that is so impactful, but also the practical, forward-looking style of instruction.

Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning Martina Solano Soto is on a mission to pursue her passion for physics and, ultimately, to solve big problems. Since she was a kid, she has had a lot of questions: Why do animals exist? What are we doing here? Why don’t we know more about the Big Bang? And she has been determined to find answers. “That’s why I found MIT OpenCourseWare,” says Solano, of Girona, Spain. “When I was 14, I started to browse and wanted to find information that was reliable, dynamic, and updated.

Solano, who is now 17, has studied quantum physics via OpenCourseWare — also part of MIT Open Learning — and she has taken Open Learning Library courses on electricity and magnetism, calculus, quantum computation, and kinematics. She even created her own syllabus, complete with homework, to ensure she stayed on track and kept her goals in mind. Those goals include studying math and physics as an undergraduate. She also hopes to study general relativity and quantum mechanics at the doctoral level. “I really want to unify them to find a theory of quantum gravity,” she says. “I want to spend all my life studying and learning.” Solano was particularly motivated by Barton Zwiebach, professor of physics, whose courses Quantum Physics I and Quantum Physics II are available on MIT OpenCourseWare.

As a high school student, she has things other than string theory on her mind: her school, extracurriculars, friends, and family. For anyone in a similar position, she recommends “figuring out what you’re most interested in and how you can take advantage of the flexibility of Open Learning resources. Is there a half-hour before bed to watch a video, or some time on the weekend to read lecture notes? If you figure out how to make it work for you, it is definitely worth the effort.” “If you do that, you are going to grow academically and personally,” Solano says. “When you go to school, you will feel more confident.” And Solano is not slowing down. She plans to continue using Open Learning resources, this time turning her attention to graduate-level courses, all in service of her curiosity and drive for knowledge. “When I was younger, I read the book &lsquo;The God Equation,&rsquo; by Michio Kaku, which explains quantum gravity theory.

In her second year at university, Eldouma struggled with her first coding courses in C&#43;&#43; and C#, which are general-purpose programming languages. When a teaching assistant introduced Eldouma and her classmates to MIT OpenCourseWare for additional support, she promptly worked through OpenCourseWare’s C&#43;&#43; and C courses in tandem with her in-person classes. This began Eldouma’s ongoing connection with the open educational resources available through MIT Open Learning. OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, offers a free collection of materials from thousands of MIT courses, spanning the entire curriculum. To date, Eldouma has explored over 20 OpenCourseWare courses, and she says it is a resource she returns to regularly. Sujood from Sudan: An Open Learner&rsquo;s Story Video: MIT OpenCourseWare.

While Eldouma loves math, she always wanted to find ways to use it for good. Through the early exposure to data science and statistical methods at her university, she saw how data science leverages math for real-world impact. After graduation, she took a job at the DAL Group, the largest Sudanese conglomerate, where she helped to incorporate data science and new technologies to automate processes within the company. When civil war erupted in Sudan in April 2023, life as Eldouma knew it was turned upside down, and her family was forced to make the difficult choice to relocate to Egypt.

She also found community, support, and inspiration from her classmates who were connected to each other not just by their academic pursuits, but by their shared life challenges. The cohort of 100 students stayed in close contact through the program, both for casual conversation and for group work. “In the final step of the Emerging Talent program, learners apply their computer and data knowledge in an experiential learning opportunity,” says Megan Mitchell, associate director for Pathways for Talent and acting director of J-WEL. “The experiential learning opportunity takes the form of an internship, apprenticeship, or an independent or collaborative project, and allows students to apply their knowledge in real-world settings and build practical skills.” Determined to apply her newly acquired knowledge in a meaningful way, Eldouma and fellow displaced Suda"}

The group identified access to education as a major problem facing Sudanese people, with schooling disrupted due to the conflict. Focusing on the higher education audience, the group partnered with community platform Nas Al Sudan to create a centralized database where students can search for scholarships and other opportunities to continue their education. Eldouma completed the MIT Emerging Talent program in June 2024 with a clear vision to pursue a career in data science, and the confidence to achieve that goal. In fact, she had already taken the steps to get there: halfway through the certificate program, she applied and was accepted to the MITx MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science at Open Learning and the London School of Economics (LSE) Masters of Science in Data Science. In January 2024, Eldouma started the MicroMasters program with 12 of her Emerging Talent peers.

For Ukrainian high school senior Sofiia Lipkevych and other students, MIT OpenCourseWare has provided valuable opportunities to take courses in key subject areas. However, while multiple Ukrainian students study English, many do not yet have sufficient command of the language to be able to fully understand and use the often very technical and complex OpenCourseWare content and materials. “At my school, I saw firsthand how language barriers prevented many Ukrainian students from accessing world-class education,” says Lipkevych.

By Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning Bernardo Picão has been interested in online learning since the early days of YouTube, when his father showed him a TED Talk. But it was with MIT Open Learning that he realized just how transformational digital resources can be. “YouTube was my first introduction to the idea that you can actually learn stuff via the internet,” Picão says. “So, when I became interested in mathematics and physics when I was 15 or 16, I turned to the internet and stumbled upon some playlists from MIT OpenCourseWare and went from there.” OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, offers free online educational resources from over 2,500 MIT undergraduate and graduate courses. Since discovering it, Picão has explored linear algebra with Gilbert Strang, professor emeritus of mathematics — whom Picão calls “a legend” — and courses on metaphysics, functional analysis, quantum field theory, and English.

Some courses provided different perspectives on material he was learning in his classes, while others filled gaps in his knowledge or satisfied his curiosity. Overall, Picão says that MIT resources made him a more robust scientist. He is currently completing a master’s degree in physics at the Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon, Portugal, where he researches prominent lattice quantum chromodynamics, an approach to the study of quarks that uses precise computer simulations. After completing his master’s degree, Picão says he will continue to a doctoral program in the field. At a recent symposium in Lisbon, Picão attended a lecture given by someone he had first seen in an OpenCourseWare video — Krishna Rajagopal, the William A. M.

While he enjoys his research, Picão’s passion is teaching. OpenCourseWare has helped him with that too, by providing models for how to teach math and science and how to connect with learners of different abilities and backgrounds. “I’m a very philosophical person,” he says. “I used to think that knowledge was intrinsically secluded in the large bindings of books, beyond the classroom walls, or inside the idiosyncratic minds of professors. OpenCourseWare changed how I think about teaching and what a university is — the point is not to keep knowledge inside of it, but to spread it.” Picão, now a teaching assistant at his institution, has been teaching since his days as a high school student tutoring his classmates or talking with members of his family. “I spent my youth sharing my knowledge with my grandmother and my extended family, including people who weren’t able to attend school past the fourth grade,” he says. “Seeing them g"}

But, he acknowledges, he is a person who has access to high-quality instruction even without Open Learning. For learners who do not have that access, Open Learning is invaluable. “It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the importance of such a project.

She earned her bachelor’s degree in clinical and behavioral psychology, and then worked as a psychologist and therapist for several years before taking a sabbatical in her late 20s to study at the London Contemporary Dance School and The Royal Ballet — fulfilling a long-time dream. “In hindsight, I think what drew me most to ballet was not so much the form itself,” says Adams, “but more of a subconscious desire to make sense of my body moving through space and time, my emotions and motivations — all within a discipline that is rigorous, meticulous, and routine-based. It’s an endeavor to make sense of the world and myself.” After acquiring some dance-related injuries, Adams returned to psychology.

In 2022, in search of new things to learn and apply to both her work and personal life, Adams discovered MIT OpenCourseWare within MIT Open Learning. She was drawn to class 8.04 (Quantum Physics I), which specifically focuses on quantum mechanics, as she was hoping to finally gain some understanding of complex topics that she had tried to teach herself in the past with limited success. She credits the course’s lectures, taught by Allan Adams (physicist and principal investigator of the MIT Future Ocean Lab), with finally making these challenging topics approachable. “I still talk to my friends at length about exciting moments in these lectures,” says Adams. “After the first class, I was hooked.” Adams’s journey through MIT Open Learning’s educational resources quickly led to a deeper interest in computational neuroscience.

She further enhanced her understanding of AI with the Minds and Machines course on MITx Online, part of Open Learning. Adams is now in the process of completing Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, taught by John Guttag; Eric Grimson, former interim vice president for Open Learning; and Ana Bell. “I am multilingual, and I think the way my brain processes code is similar to the way computers code,” says Adams. “I find learning to code similar to learning a foreign language: both exhilarating and intimidating. Learning the rules, deciphering the syntax, and building my own world through code is one of the most fascinating challenges of my life.” Adams is also pursuing a master’s degree at Duke and the University College of London, focusing on the neurobiology of sleep and looking particularly at how the biochemistry of the brain can affect this critical function.

By Sara Feijo | MIT Open Learning When June Odongo interviewed early-career electrical engineer Cynthia Wacheke for a software engineering position at her company, Wacheke lacked knowledge of computer science theory but showed potential in complex problem-solving. Determined to give Wacheke a shot, Odongo turned to MIT OpenCourseWare to create a six-month “bridging course” modeled after the classes she once took as a computer science student. Part of MIT Open Learning, OpenCourseWare offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 courses that span the MIT undergraduate and graduate curriculum. “Wacheke had the potential and interest to do the work that needed to be done, so the way to solve this was for me to literally create a path for her to get that work done,” says Odongo, founder and CEO of Senga Technologies.

It’s insane how good of a team member she is. She has done so much in such a short time.” Making high-quality candidates job-ready Wacheke, who holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nairobi, started her professional career as a hardware engineer. She discovered a passion for software while working on a dashboard design project, and decided to pivot from hardware to software engineering. That’s when she discovered Senga Technologies, a logistics software and services company in Kenya catering to businesses that ship in Africa. Odongo founded Senga with the goal of simplifying and easing the supply chain and logistics experience, from the movement of goods to software tools. Senga’s ultimate goal, Odongo says, is to have most of their services driven by software. That means employees — and candidates — need to be able to think through complex problems using computer science theory. “A lot of people are focused on programming, but we care less about programming and more about problem-solving,”"}

She took nine courses, including: Introduction to Algorithms; Mathematics for Computer Science; Design and Analysis of Algorithms; Elements of Software Construction; Automata, Computability, and Complexity; Database Systems; Principles of Autonomy and Decision Making; Introduction to Machine Learning; and Networks. “The bridging course helped me learn how to think through things,” Wacheke says. “It’s one thing to know how to do something, but it’s another to design that thing from scratch and implement it.” During the bridging course, Wacheke was paired with a software engineer at Senga, who mentored her and answered questions along the way.

Continuous learning for team members The bridging course concluded with a presentation to Senga employees, during which Wacheke explained how the company could use graph theory for decision-making. “If you want to get from point A to B, there are algorithms you can use to find the shortest path,” Wacheke says. “Since we’re a logistics company, I thought we could use this when we’re deciding which routes our trucks take.” The presentation, which is the final requirement for the bridging course, is also a professional development opportunity for Senga employees. “This process is helpful for our team members, particularly those who have been out of school for a while,” Odongo says. “The candidates present what they’ve learned in relation to Senga.

By Katherine Ouellette | MIT Open Learning Andrea Henshall, a retired major in the U.S. Air Force and current MIT PhD student, has completed seven tours of combat, two years of aerial circus performance, and three higher education degrees (so far). But throughout each step of her journey, all roads seemed to point to MIT. Currently working on her doctoral degree with an MIT master’s already in her toolkit, she is quick to attribute her academic success to MIT’s open educational resources. “I kept coming back to MIT-produced open source learning,” she says. “MIT dominates in educational philanthropy when it comes to free high-quality learning sources.” To this day, Henshall recommends MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) and MITx courses to students and her fellow veterans who are transitioning out of the service. A love of flight and a drive to excel Henshall first discovered OCW as she was pursuing her master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. Transitioning from an applied engineering program at the United States Air Force Academy to a more theoretical program proved a challenge for Henshall, and her first semester grades got her put on academic probation.

During Independent Activities Period, she took Professor Gilbert Strang’s linear algebra courses on OCW, which included both videos and homework. Henshall found Strang very engaging and easy to learn from and found it helpful to work through the homework when they had the solutions available. She was able to lift her grades the following semester, and by the end of her program, she was getting all A’s. Henshall says, “OpenCourseWare really saved me. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to complete my master’s.” Ever since Henshall learned the term “astronautical engineer” in the fourth grade, she knew what she wanted to be when she grew up. That early love of outer space and building things led her to a bachelor’s degree in astronautical engineering and the Air Force. There she served as a research and development officer, instructor pilot, and chief financial officer of her squadron. But a non-combat-related injury forced her to medically retire from being a pilot. “I was not doing well physically, and it was impossible for me to get hired to be a pilot outside of the Air Force.” After a brief detour as a part-time aerial circus performer, she decided to go back to school.

Henshall says, “I had to translate the work I had done in the military into something relevant for an academic application, and the language they were looking for was very different from what I was used to.” She thought acquiring more recent academic work might help improve her application. She attended Auburn University for her second master’s degree (this time in computer science and software engineering) and started a PhD. Again she turned to MIT OCW to supplement her studies. Henshall says, “I remembered vividly how much it had helped me in 2005, so of course that’s where I was going to start. Then I noticed that OCW linked to MITx, which had more interactive quizzes.” The OCW platform had also become more robust since she had first used it. “Back then, it was new, there wasn’t necessarily a standard,” she says. Over 10 years later, she found that most courses had more material, videos, and notes that more closely approximated an MIT course experience.

Her focus is controls systems with a minor in quantum information. She says, “I’m literally living my dream. I’m at my dream school with my dream advisor.” Working with Professor Sertac Karaman in LIDS, Henshall plans to write her thesis on multi-agent reinforcement learning. But her relationship with online learning is far from over; again she has turned to OCW and MITx resources for the foundation to succeed in subjects such as controls, machine learning, quantum mechanics, and quantum computation. When the pandemic struck the East Coast, Henshall was only nine months into her PhD program at MIT. The pivot to online learning made it difficult to continue building relationships with classmates.

Currently, she works collaboratively on two major projects related to her PhD thesis and her career path after she completes the program. The first project is an AI accelerator program through the Air Force. Her work with unmanned aerial vehicles (a.k.a. drones) uses a small quadrotor to autonomously and quickly search a building using reinforcement learning. The primary intended use is search and rescue. The second project involves research into multi-agent reinforcement learning and pathfinding.

By Duyen Nguyen | MIT Open Learning About two years ago, a group of medical students at Ege University Faculty of Medicine in Turkey began meeting to study single variable calculus. None of the students had taken a course in this subject before. But with the guidance of lectures, slides, and other freely available resources on MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW), they soon advanced onto multivariable calculus. Then differential equations. Then linear algebra. Today, the students, who call their study group İleri Çalışmalar, or “Advanced Studies,” are paving their own road toward doctoral-level studies — with MIT OCW as their main resource. “Our motivation is to create a theoretical background in order to do research while we’re studying in medical school,” says Yıldırım Adalıoğlu, one of the study group’s co-founders, who explains that MD-PhD programs, which prepare student"}

We decided to create that for ourselves.” Using OCW courses to build their own curriculum, the members of İleri Çalışmalar have developed an independent program of study while working toward their medical degrees. The study group devotes about three months — the equivalent of an MIT semester — to each course in their curriculum. While most of their peers are on the clinician path, the group co-founded by Sıla Özkal, Begüm Tahhan, and Çağan Kaplan typically draws six to 10 students per course. Support and collaboration to pursue focused interests Depending on their schedule, Kaplan explains, the students meet weekly to discuss the OCW lectures and to review course materials. At each meeting, one or more members of the group volunteer to recap the lectures and to facilitate discussion. For new courses — like probability, the group’s current focus — the students approach discussion sessions collaboratively. “After nearly two years of medical coursework,” Adalıoğlu says, “we can now teach and adapt the"}

For instance, over the summer a few students from the group interned at a biomedicine and genome research center. They drew on the knowledge they gained from classes 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python) and 6.0002 (Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science) to work on a study on analyzing the effects of mutations in a specific protein. The internship called for a background in computational research and data analysis. Thanks to MIT OCW, the İleri Çalışmalar students were well-prepared, says Adalıoğlu. “If we didn’t have the Python course from MIT, then we couldn’t go to the lab and do the internship there.” Combining their medical interests with their OCW coursework, Adalıoğlu and Kaplan also developed a computational model to study the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany.

That’s why when we decide to do a computational project, either we solve the problems ourselves or we ask for help from professors from other universities and labs.” For Tahhan, who interned at a government science institute, where she studied hyperlipidemia in pediatric patients, the OCW courses have opened new areas of interest. “I realized I was interested in biochemistry when I took the 5.08J Biological Chemistry II course from OCW, so I applied for the internship,” she says. Özkal, who attends a cancer research internship, also credits the OCW courses that İleri Çalışmalar has covered with advancing her research goals. The tool kits to build their own future Currently in their third and fourth years of medical school, the İleri Çalışmalar founders note that OpenCourseWare has been a useful supplement to their medical studies as well.

And it was while searching for the answer to an AI-related question that Kasigazi first discovered MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW). “Here they were, all these courses by one of the best — if not the best — schools in tech in the world, and they were free. For a long time I couldn’t believe it.

For Kasigazi, the channel became a gateway to other open education resources, including the OpenCourseWare website and MITx courses, both part of MIT Open Learning. “I always had the questions — I grew up on science cartoons like &lsquo;Dexter’s Laboratory&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pinky and the Brain&rsquo; — so I would go on YouTube to try to find answers to these questions, and I found this whole other world,” he says. OCW launched its YouTube channel in 2008, and this August passed 4 million subscribers. While introductory computer science, math, and physics are the most-visited courses on the OCW website, the most popular YouTube videos reflect a more diverse range of interests, including a lecture about piloting a fighter jet aircraft, an introduction to the human brain, and an introduction to financial terms and concepts. Through this extensive collection, Kasigazi explains that he’s been able to explore “the things I love,” while also studying cloud computing, data science, and AI — fields that he plans to pursue in graduate studies.

Nurturing a worldview In 2014 Kasigazi moved to South Sudan, which had only recently emerged from a civil war as an independent nation. Fresh out of university, he was there to teach computer skills and graphic design — some of his students included members of the new country’s government — but his time in South Sudan quickly became a learning experience for him, too. “When you grow up in your community, you have this bubble. We all experience it — it’s a human thing,” he reflects. “For the first time, I realized that everything I knew is not a given.

But Guerrero still recognizes the importance of continuing his education despite having a front-row seat to the genome industry since its inception. Guerrero received a degree in biology from University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 1992, and joined the workforce of thousands of sequencers mapping DNA. However, six years after leaving his job as a sequencing associate at Incyte, a lecturer at UC Berkeley informed Guerrero that the technology used to sequence the human genome had already become obsolete. “This stark contrast highlights the rapid pace of technological evolution in this field,” says Guerrero. “Motivated by this insight, I decided to return to school, starting with a course in genetics.” That’s when Guerrero enrolled as a part-time student at Pasadena City College in Los Angeles in 2016. Since then, he continues to deepen his knowledge with MIT Open Learning educational resources. “I decided to update my skills in the sciences because they change rapidly,” says Guerrero.

While searching for extra study materials to practice key concepts from his Pasadena City College courses, Guerrero was thrilled to find that MIT OpenCourseWare, part of Open Learning, offers a comprehensive collection of educational materials from thousands of MIT courses all in one place. “Due to the excellent array of available biology courses, I selectively explore topics from various OpenCourseWare course materials according to the particular concepts I wish to comprehend,” he says. Guerrero appreciates that OpenCourseWare dives deep into specific topics through an assortment of quizzes, exams, lecture notes, and videos. “It does challenge you to learn the concept, while at the same time, retaining it much better,” says Guerrero. MIT’s approach is different from how he first learned these concepts as an undergraduate — which he describes as “brute force memorization.” In one OpenCourseWare biology course lecture, for example, Guerrero studied a diagram of a cell that traced the path from nucleus to DNA. During a later assignment about protein production, he made the connection, “Oh, it goes by path. It’s organized,” he says.

You can access what you want and it’s free.” Additionally, OpenCourseWare’s Creative Commons license allows anyone to modify, remix, and reuse its resources. This is particularly important for community colleges, like Pasadena City College, participating in California’s Zero Textbook Cost Program. The strength of OpenCourseWare for educators and students, Guerrero says, is that “people know it’s coming from a reliable, verified source — coming from MIT.” Researching medical applications After three decades in the biotech industry with roles ranging from research and development, to production, to quality assurance, Guerrero aspires to return to DNA research. He hopes to use advanced technologies that weren’t available during his previous time in the field — such as Next Generation Sequencing and CRISPR — to develop new medical applications.

Her parents had started a skiing company, and the seasonal work meant that Gaul had to change schools every six months. Growing up in small towns in Australia and Canada, she relied on the internet to fuel her curiosity. “I went to 13 different schools, which was hard because you&rsquo;re in a different educational system every single time,” says Gaul. “That’s one of the reasons I gravitated toward online learning and teaching myself. Knowledge is something that exists beyond a curriculum.” The small towns she lived in often didn’t have a lot of resources, she says, so a computer served as a main tool for learning. She enjoyed engaging with Wikipedia, ultimately researching topics and writing and editing content for pages. In 2018, she discovered MIT OpenCourseWare, part of MIT Open Learning, and took her first course.

She says that a highlight was when she built a life-sized, working version of a Mario Kart, constructed out of materials she had printed. Gaul calls herself a “serial learner,” and has taken many OpenCourseWare courses. In addition to classes on circuits and electronics, she also took courses in linear algebra, calculus, and quantum physics — in which she took a particular interest. When she was 15, she participated in Qubit by Qubit.

For the blog, she found different topics and researched them in depth. She would think of a topic or question, such as “What is color?” and then explore it in great detail. What she learned eventually led her to start asking questions such as “What is a hamiltonian?” and teaching quantum physics alongside PhDs. Building on these interests, Gaul chose to study quantum engineering at the University of New South Wales. She notes that on her first day of university, she participated in iQuHack, the MIT Quantum Hackathon. Her team worked to find a new way to approximate the value of a hyperbolic function using quantum logic, and received an honorable mention for “exceptional creativity.” Gaul’s passion for making things continued during her college days, especially in terms of innovating to solve a problem.

Gaul says she has always had an interest in VR, using it to create her own worlds, reconstruct an old childhood house, and play Dungeons and Dragons with friends. She discovered a way to put into a glove some small linear resonant actuators, which can be found in a smartphone or gaming controller, and map to any object in VR so that the user can feel it.

At the time of his first, fateful Osaka train ride, Yamahara lived in Atlanta, after having spent most of his elementary school years in rural Tennessee. Before that, he and his family had lived in Los Angeles. In all those places, he says, it was difficult for kids to get around. In fact, getting around without a car could be a challenge for anyone. Whenever he visited family in Japan, he was in awe of the efficiency of the train system and the ease of learning how to navigate it, in addition to the mixed-use buildings that combined commercial and residential spaces. As a 10-year-old, he simply thought they “were really cool” and quite different from what he saw at home. Now, he reflects on the efficient use of space in a country that is much smaller than the expansive United States. Back at home, Yamahara continued to reimagine the spaces around him, often printing out satellite imagery and drawing new possibilities over what existed. “Maybe instead of a giant parking lot, I’d draw a subway station and connect it to another part of the map,” he says. “But it was all imaginary.

Yamahara dove into the content, starting with 11.001J (Introduction to Urban Design and Development). He has since accessed a variety of courses and counts 11.948 (Power of Place: Media Technology, Youth, and City Design and Development) and 11.304J (Site and Infrastructure Systems Planning) among the most memorable. Exploring OpenCourseWare resources gave him a strong foundation to take his interest in urban planning and redesign into the real world. In summer 2025, Yamahara completed an internship with an Atlanta-area real estate firm working on a redesign project with a city agency. “Right now, this city has a downtown area with a lot of parking lots and empty retail spaces.

As Yamahara looks toward college and his future, he says he sees two paths influenced by MIT’s free educational resources. On one path, he studies urban planning, as OpenCourseWare materials have only reaffirmed his passion for the field and given him knowledge and confidence. On another path, he imagines using his time as an undergraduate to explore other interests, including aviation and real estate. On that path, OpenCourseWare would allow him to continue his urban planning education independently.

Purpose in adversity Soon after relocating to Egypt, Eldouma lost her job and found herself struggling to find purpose in the life circumstances she had been handed. Due to visa restrictions, challenges getting right-to-work permits, and a complicated employment market in Egypt, she was also unable to find a new job. “I was sort of in a depressive episode, because of all that was happening,” she reflects. “It just hit me that I lost everything that I know, everything that I love. I’m in a new country. I need to start from scratch.” Around this time, a friend who knew Eldouma was curious about data science sent her the link to apply to the MIT Emerging Talent Certificate in Data and Computer Science. With less than 24 hours before the application deadline, Eldouma hit “Submit.” Finding community and joy through learning Part of MIT Open Learning, MIT Emerging Talent at the MIT Jameel World Education Lab (J-WEL) develops global education programs that target the needs of talented individuals from challenging economic and social circumstances by equipping them with the knowledge and tools to advance their education and careers.

Although Eldouma had used data science in her role at the DAL Group, she was happy to have a proper introduction to the field and to find joy in learning again. She also found community, support, and inspiration from her classmates who were connected to each other not just by their academic pursuits, but by their shared life challenges. The cohort of 100 students stayed in close contact through the program, both for casual conversation and for group work. “In the final step of the Emerging Talent program, learners apply their computer and data knowledge in an experiential learning opportunity,” says Megan Mitchell, associate director for Pathways for Talent and acting director of J-WEL. “The experiential learning opportunity takes the form of an internship, apprenticeship, or an independent or collaborative project, and allows students to apply their knowledge in real"}

The group identified access to education as a major problem facing Sudanese people, with schooling disrupted due to the conflict. Focusing on the higher education audience, the group partnered with community platform Nas Al Sudan to create a centralized database where students can search for scholarships and other opportunities to continue their education. Eldouma completed the MIT Emerging Talent program in June 2024 with a clear vision to pursue a career in data science, and the confidence to achieve that goal. In fact, she had already taken the steps to get there: halfway through the certificate program, she applied and was accepted to the MITx MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science at Open Learning and the London School of Economics (LSE) Masters of Science in Data Science.

Stefanie Koperniak | MIT Open Learning With war continuing to disrupt education for millions of Ukrainian high school and college students, many are turning to online resources, including MIT OpenCourseWare, a part of MIT Open Learning offering educational materials from more than 2,500 MIT undergraduate and graduate courses. For Ukrainian high school senior Sofiia Lipkevych and other students, MIT OpenCourseWare has provided valuable opportunities to take courses in key subject areas. However, while multiple Ukrainian students study English, many do not yet have sufficient command of the language to be able to fully understand and use the often very technical and complex OpenCourseWare content and materials. “At my school, I saw firsthand how language barriers prevented many Ukrainian students from accessing world-class education,” says Lipkevych.

Since OpenCourseWare and other Open Learning programs offer such a wide range of free educational resources from MIT, learners can explore similar courses from different instructors to get new perspectives and round out their knowledge. While he enjoys his research, Picão’s passion is teaching. OpenCourseWare has helped him with that too, by providing models for how to teach math and science and how to connect with learners of different abilities and backgrounds. “I’m a very philosophical person,” he says. “I used to think that knowledge was intrinsically secluded in the large bindings of books, beyond the classroom walls, or inside the idiosyncratic minds of professors. OpenCourseWare changed how I think about teaching and what a university is — the point is not to keep knowledge inside of it, but to spread it.” Picão, now a teaching assistant at his institution, has been teaching since his days as a high school student tutoring his classmates or talking with members of his family. “I spent my youth sharing my know"}

By Sara Feijo | MIT Open Learning When June Odongo interviewed early-career electrical engineer Cynthia Wacheke for a software engineering position at her company, Wacheke lacked knowledge of computer science theory but showed potential in complex problem-solving. Determined to give Wacheke a shot, Odongo turned to MIT OpenCourseWare to create a six-month “bridging course” modeled after the classes she once took as a computer science student. Part of MIT Open Learning, OpenCourseWare offers free, online, open educational resources from more than 2,500 courses that span the MIT undergraduate and graduate curriculum. “Wacheke had the potential and interest to do the work that needed to be done, so the way to solve this was for me to literally create a path for her to get that work done,” says Odongo, f"}

She created a new website that included an integration to channel external requests to Slack, a cross-platform team communication tool used by the company’s employees. Continuous learning for team members The bridging course concluded with a presentation to Senga employees, during which Wacheke explained how the company could use graph theory for decision-making. “If you want to get from point A to B, there are algorithms you can use to find the shortest path,” Wacheke says. “Since we’re a logistics company, I thought we could use this when we’re deciding which routes our trucks take.” The presentation, which is the final requirement for the bridging course, is also a professional development opportunity for Senga employees. “This process is helpful for our team members, particularly those who have been out of school for a while,” Odongo says. “The candidates present what they’ve learned in relation to Senga.

By Katherine Ouellette | MIT Open Learning Andrea Henshall, a retired major in the U.S. Air Force and current MIT PhD student, has completed seven tours of combat, two years of aerial circus performance, and three higher education degrees (so far). But throughout each step of her journey, all roads seemed to point to MIT. Currently working on her doctoral degree with an MIT master’s already in her toolkit, she is quick to attribute her academic success to MIT’s open educational resources. “I kept coming back to MIT-produced open source learning,” she says. “MIT dominates in educational philanthropy when it comes to free high-quality learning sources.” To this day, Henshall recommends MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) and MITx courses to students and her fellow veterans who are transitioning out of the service. A love of flight and a drive to excel Henshall first discovered OCW as she was pursuing her master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.

Transitioning from an applied engineering program at the United States Air Force Academy to a more theoretical program proved a challenge for Henshall, and her first semester grades got her put on academic probation. During Independent Activities Period, she took Professor Gilbert Strang’s linear algebra courses on OCW, which included both videos and homework. Henshall found Strang very engaging and easy to learn from and found it helpful to work through the homework when they had the solutions available. She was able to lift her grades the following semester, and by the end of her program, she was getting all A’s. Henshall says, “OpenCourseWare really saved me. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to complete my master’s.” Ever since Henshall learned the term “astronautical engineer” in the fourth grade, she knew what she wanted to be when she grew up. That early love of outer space and building things led her to a bachelor’s degree in astronautical engineering and the Air Force. There she served as a research and development officer, instructor pilot, and chief financial officer of her squadron. But a non-combat-related injury forced her to medically retire from being a pilot. “I was not doing well physically, and it was impossible for me to get hired to be a pilot outside of the Air Force.” After a brief detour as a part-time aerial circus performer, she decided to go b"}

Henshall says, “I had to translate the work I had done in the military into something relevant for an academic application, and the language they were looking for was very different from what I was used to.” She thought acquiring more recent academic work might help improve her application. She attended Auburn University for her second master’s degree (this time in computer science and software engineering) and started a PhD. Again she turned to MIT OCW to supplement her studies. Henshall says, “I remembered vividly how much it had helped me in 2005, so of course that’s where I was going to start. Then I noticed that OCW linked to MITx, which had more interactive quizzes.” The OCW platform had also become more robust since she had first used it. “Back then, it was new, there wasn’t necessarily a standard,” she says.

Those additional open education resources gave Henshall an extra edge to complete a 21-month program in 12 months with a 4.0 GPA. Her advisor told her that she had the best thesis defense he had seen in 25 years. In 2019, Henshall’s success helped her get accepted to MIT’s PhD program in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, in the Autonomy and Embedded Robotics Accelerated (AERA) lab under the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), with a Lester Durand Gardner Fellowship. Her focus is controls systems with a minor in quantum information. She says, “I’m literally living my dream. I’m at my dream school with my dream advisor.” Working with Professor Sertac Karaman in LIDS, Henshall plans to write her thesis on multi-agent reinforcement learning. But her relationship with online learning is far from over; again she has turned to OCW and MITx resources for the foundation to succeed in subjects such as controls, machine learning, quantum mechanics, and quantum computation.

Currently, she works collaboratively on two major projects related to her PhD thesis and her career path after she completes the program. The first project is an AI accelerator program through the Air Force. Her work with unmanned aerial vehicles (a.k.a. drones) uses a small quadrotor to autonomously and quickly search a building using reinforcement learning. The primary intended use is search and rescue. The second project involves research into multi-agent reinforcement learning and pathfinding.

By Duyen Nguyen | MIT Open Learning About two years ago, a group of medical students at Ege University Faculty of Medicine in Turkey began meeting to study single variable calculus. None of the students had taken a course in this subject before. But with the guidance of lectures, slides, and other freely available resources on MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW), they soon advanced onto multivariable calculus. Then differential equations. Then linear algebra.

We decided to create that for ourselves.” Using OCW courses to build their own curriculum, the members of İleri Çalışmalar have developed an independent program of study while working toward their medical degrees. The study group devotes about three months — the equivalent of an MIT semester — to each course in their curriculum. While most of their peers are on the clinician path, the group co-founded by Sıla Özkal, Begüm Tahhan, and Çağan Kaplan typically draws six to 10 students per course. Support and collaboration to pursue focused interests Depending on their schedule, Kaplan explains, the students meet weekly to discuss the OCW lectures and to review course materials.

For instance, over the summer a few students from the group interned at a biomedicine and genome research center. They drew on the knowledge they gained from classes 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python) and 6.0002 (Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science) to work on a study on analyzing the effects of mutations in a specific protein. The internship called for a background in computational research and data analysis. Thanks to MIT OCW, the İleri Çalışmalar students were well-prepared, says Adalıoğlu. “If we didn’t have the Python course from MIT, then we couldn’t go to the lab and do the internship there.” Combining their medical interests with their OCW coursework, Adalıoğlu and Kaplan also developed a computational model to study the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany.

There aren’t many people on the medical faculty that work on computational projects. That’s why when we decide to do a computational project, either we solve the problems ourselves or we ask for help from professors from other universities and labs.” For Tahhan, who interned at a government science institute, where she studied hyperlipidemia in pediatric patients, the OCW courses have opened new areas of interest. “I realized I was interested in biochemistry when I took the 5.08J Biological Chemistry II course from OCW, so I applied for the internship,” she says.

He searched for more information on OCW and tried the channel on different browsers to triple-check its credibility. “Here they were, all these courses by one of the best — if not the best — schools in tech in the world, and they were free. For a long time I couldn’t believe it. I told everyone I knew,” he remembers. For Kasigazi, the channel became a gateway to other open education resources, including the OpenCourseWare website and MITx courses, both part of MIT Open Learning. “I always had the questions — I grew up on science cartoons like &lsquo;Dexter’s Laboratory&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pinky and the Brain&rsquo; — so I would go on YouTube to try to find answers to these questions, and I found this whole other world,” he says. OCW launched its YouTube channel in 2008, and this August passed 4 million subscribers. While introductory computer science, math, and physics are the most-visited courses on the OCW website, the most popular YouTube videos reflect a more diverse range of interests, including a lecture about piloting a fighter jet aircraft, an introduction to the human brain, and an introduction to financial terms and concepts. Through this extensive collection, Kasigazi explains that he’s been able to explore “the things I love,” while also studying cloud computing, data science, and AI — fields that"}

Through this extensive collection, Kasigazi explains that he’s been able to explore “the things I love,” while also studying cloud computing, data science, and AI — fields that he plans to pursue in graduate studies. He says, “This is what OpenCourseWare has enabled me to do: I get the chance to not only watch the future happen, but I can actually be a part of it and create it.” Understanding humanity through the liberal arts When Kasigazi was young, a beloved aunt recognized his natural curiosity and steered him toward the best schools. “I owe her everything,” he says, “everything I am is because of her.” Thanks to his excellent grades he received an academic scholarship from the Ugandan government to attend Makerere University, one of the top universities in sub-Saharan Africa, where he earned a degree in information systems. Having pursued IT for its practical applications, Kasigazi admits that he was initially more interested in the science and theory behind computers than “the coding bits of it.” “I love the concept of it — how we are trying to make these machines,” he says, explaining that he’s long been drawn to the social sciences and humanities, particularly psychology and philosophy. “I’m interested in how we work as human beings, because everything we do is for, with, and around human beings,” says Kasigazi, who considers psychology to be foun"}

So first teach them what people think, how they act — that was my drive to love psychology.” Kasigazi has also turned to OCW to brush up on his coding skills, watching 6.0001 (Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python) lectures with Professor Ana Bell and reviewing the instructor-paced version with Professor Eric Grimson now on MITx. “I am proud to say MIT OCW has made me fall in love with coding … it makes sense like it never has before,” he says. Nurturing a worldview In 2014 Kasigazi moved to South Sudan, which had only recently emerged from a civil war as an independent nation. Fresh out of university, he was there to teach computer skills and graphic design — some of his students included members of the new country’s government — but his time in South Sudan quickly became a learning experience for him, too. “When you grow up in your community, you have this bubble. We all experience it — it’s a human thing,” he reflects. “For the first time, I realized that everything I knew is not a given. Everything I grew up knowing is not universal.” With"}

Everything I grew up knowing is not universal.” With his worldview newly broadened, he began to nurture his interest in psychology, philosophy, and the sciences, watching crash courses, explainer videos, and other content on the subject. “It’s entertainment, to me, at the same time that it’s a passion,” he says. Today Kasigazi runs his own company, which he started in 2012 with friends and resumed when he returned to Uganda seven years ago. Since coming across the OCW YouTube channel, Kasigazi has worked through all of the freely available MIT psychology courses. Professor John Gabrieli’s 9.00SC (Introduction to Psychology) have particularly resonated with him, even prompting him to reach out to Gabrieli. “As much as I’d been getting some knowledge on psychology over the years online, it wasn’t as deep and as interesting or captivating as your classes were,” he wrote. “From your teaching style, to the explanations, to the topics, to how you make people understand a topic, to the experiments mentioned and referenced, to how you approach questions and later make one think deeper about them.” “The message from Emmanuel is deeply touching about the joy of learning,” says Gabrieli, who is also an investigator at the McGovern Institute. “"}

Kasigazi, who’s currently enjoying 9.13 (Introduction to the Human Brain) from professor and McGovern Institute investigator Nancy Kanwisher, looks forward to discovering what new worlds of knowledge they’ll open.

Katherine Ouellette | MIT Open Learning Over Juan Guerrero’s 33-year biotechnology career, he has watched gene editing evolve from theory to reality. But Guerrero still recognizes the importance of continuing his education despite having a front-row seat to the genome industry since its inception. Guerrero received a degree in biology from University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 1992, and joined the workforce of thousands of sequencers mapping DNA. However, six years after leaving his job as a sequencing associate at Incyte, a lecturer at UC Berkeley informed Guerrero that the technology used to sequence the human genome had already become obsolete. “This stark contrast highlights the rapid pace of technological evolution in this field,” says Guerrero. “Motivated by this insight, I decided to return to school, starting with a course in genetics.” That’s when Guerrero enrolled as a part-time student at Pasadena City College in Los Angeles in 2016. Since then, he continues to deepen his knowledge with MIT Open Learning educational resources. “I decided to update my skills in the sciences because they change rapidly,” says Guerrero.

Strengthening understanding Guerrero credits MIT Open Learning’s online resources with making a significant difference in his academic journey over the last decade. While searching for extra study materials to practice key concepts from his Pasadena City College courses, Guerrero was thrilled to find that MIT OpenCourseWare, part of Open Learning, offers a comprehensive collection of educational materials from thousands of MIT courses all in one place. “Due to the excellent array of available biology courses, I selectively explore topics from various OpenCourseWare course materials according to the particular concepts I wish to comprehend,” he says. Guerrero appreciates that OpenCourseWare dives deep into specific topics through an assortment of quizzes, exams, lecture notes, and videos. “It does challenge you to learn the concept, while at the same time, retaining it much better,” says Guerrero. MIT’s approach is different from how he first learned these concepts as an undergraduate — which he describes as “brute force memorization.” In one OpenCourseWare biology course lecture, for example, Guerrero studied a diagram of a cell that traced the path from nucleus to DNA. During a later assignment about protein production, he made the connection, “Oh, it goes by path. It’s organized,” he says. This holi"}

During a later assignment about protein production, he made the connection, “Oh, it goes by path. It’s organized,” he says. This holistic approach to learning helped strengthen his understanding of the concept. Guerrero also appreciates the platform’s flexibility, allowing him to learn on his own schedule. “What truly sets OpenCourseWare apart is its commitment to accessibility,” Guerrero says. “Not every student needs to be enrolled in a program and OpenCourseWare has made that possible. You can access what you want and it’s free.” Additionally, OpenCourseWare’s Creative Commons license allows anyone to modify, remix, and reuse its resources. This is particularly important for community colleges, like Pasadena City College, participating in California’s Zero Textbook Cost Program. The strength of OpenCourseWare for educators and students, Guerrero says, is that “people know it’s coming from a reliable, verified source — coming from MIT.” Researching medical applications After three decades in the biotech industry with roles ranging from research and development, to production, to quality assurance, Guerrero aspires to return to DNA research. He hopes to use advanced technologies that weren’t available during his previous time in the field — such as Next Generation Sequencing and CRISPR — to develop new medical"}

It covers what subjects are taught and the standards children should reach in each subject.\nOther types of school , like academies and private schools, do not have to follow the national curriculum. Academies must teach a broad and balanced curriculum including English, maths and science. They must also teach relationships and sex education, and religious education.\nKey stages\nThe national curriculum is organised into blocks of years called ‘key stages’ (KS).\nYour child will be tested at the end of some key stages.
