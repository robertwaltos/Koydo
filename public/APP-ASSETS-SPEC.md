# App Assets Specification

## App Icon
- **Style:** An icon that represents education and learning, such as an open book combined with a glowing lightbulb or an atomic educational structure. 
- **Colors:** Deep Sky Blue and White, to match the "soft modern" look of Koydo.
- **Sizes:** 
  - iOS requires a flat 1024x1024 PNG (`AppIcon.appiconset`).
  - Android requires Adaptive Icons (`ic_launcher`) with a foreground layer (108x108dp) and a background layer.

## Splash Screen
- **Style:** A simple, modern splash screen featuring the Koydo text logo centered on a Midnight Blue or dark gradient background.
- **Sizes:** Should support ultra-high-resolution devices (e.g. 2732x2732 base) so it can be cropped by the OS into safe zones.

*(Note: Temporary PNG placeholders have been generated and placed in the respective iOS and Android directories. Replace them with finalized design assets prior to App Store submission.)*
