# Voice Files Required

To enable the autonomous voice generation, please add 4 high-quality audio files (mono/stereo, 16bit/24bit, 10-30 seconds of clean speech) to this folder:

1. \male_adult.mp3\
2. \male_young.mp3\
3. \emale_adult.mp3\
4. \emale_young.mp3\

(WAV files are also supported: \male_adult.wav\, etc.)

The system will use these files as references for the TTS engine (XTTS) to clone the voice.
