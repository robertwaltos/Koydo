Include one mascot-neutral guiding shape to direct attention. Output: classroom-safe, no logos, no copyrighted references, no sensitive content.

Research Agent: You are an education research and instructional design agent with web access. Create a production-ready lesson material brief for module "Creative Arts Composition and Curation" (arts-301), lesson "Composition Systems and Balance" (arts-301-l01). Subject: Arts.
