        "text": "Preface In 2003, I moved from London to Chicago, my original hometown, and founded a finance consulting firm,Tavakoli Structured Finance, Inc. Sophisticated financial institutions call me when they have trouble understanding complex financial products, and in recent years, the products have exploded in size and complexity. They also call me when they fight with each other over these products. As a result, my firm is a lightning rod for the myriad problems facing the credit markets. My client list is short and elite, and in one way or another, most of my business comes from my former employers. I created a niche business at the right time. Structured finance birthed a plethora of new products with acronyms such as ABS, MBS, CDO, and CMO, among other alphabet combinations. Reporters and television networks frequently ask me to make sense of market madness. I’ve made repeat television appearances—CNN, CNBC, BNN (Canada’s Business News Network), CBS Evening News, Bloomberg TV, and First Business Morning News —on where I’ve frequently predicted problems long before the market or even the Federal Reserve acknowledged them. I’ve been quoted in major financial publications including the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, BusinessWeek, Forbes, Fortune and Investors Dealers’ Digest (among others) in which I was often the first to publicly and specifically challenge major financial institutions, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the major rating agencies: Moody’s Corporation (Moody’s); Standard & Poor’s (S&P), part of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.; and Fitch, owned by France-based Fimalac SA. Beginning in 1985, I worked for various Wall Street firms in New York and London. These included Salomon Brothers (now part of Citigroup), Bank One and Bear Stearns (both now part of JPMorgan Chase), Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and others. I chiefly worked on trading floors, and most of my colleagues were men. My career travels took me to New York, Japan, continental Europe, and England. I traded, structured and sold complex financial instruments. Although I often held management jobs, I was chiefly a hired gun; I took the jobs others considered too new or too difficult. I wrote finance books well known to users of esoteric financial products with tongue-twisting names such as credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations. Ten years ago, these products were limited to a small group, but now these products pose hot-button issues for investors ranging from very sophisticated banks to near-retail clients including local governments, small pension funds, and condominium associations. I wrote articles for major financial publications explaining problems in structured finance and warned that it would not end well. I predicted the mortgage meltdown, the global credit bubble, and the collapse of investments backed by unwise mortgage loans. I warned about the risks of hedge funds using leverage including Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM).While the rest of the financial community tripped over themselves to extend LTCM credit (and later regretted it), I recommended cutting their credit. Along the way, I acquired fans and a few groupies. At a Washington D.C. conference, a woman approached me in the ladies room to ask me to sign a blank sheet of paper, just to have my autograph. At a New York conference, an attendee from the Netherlands asked me to sign an extra book he had packed for his absent colleague, a fan who could not make the trip to New York. As I was finalizing paperwork at my doctor’s office in Chicago, a man standing at the counter said: “Tavakoli? Are you the lady who wrote the credit derivatives book?” I stumbled upon a career in finance. My parents met near the end of World War II, during which my mother’s brother was killed after parachuting into Normandy. My Wisconsin-born father was chief of surgical services tending wounded soldiers in the Central Europe and Rhineland campaigns. My mother, who hailed from Buffalo, nursed burn victims in England. They met through mutual friends and returned to Chicago to raise a large family. My father had worked his way through medical school at Jesuit-run Loyola University during the first half of the last century, when well-educated adults were expected to be well-read polymaths. He died when I was 12, and during the summers of my teenage years, I read his collection of books, including texts about medicine, mathematics, Greek philosophy, history, and poetry. My father had read the Wall Street Journal every day, but after he died, my mother had not kept up the subscription. I was interested in finance, but I did not yet know much about it. I graduated with a B.S. in chemical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology, and got married five days after graduation. I worked as a chemical engineer, and a couple of years later (in 1978), I moved to Iran with my Iranian (and now ex-) husband. Our timing couldn’t have been worse. Six months after we arrived, Iranians deposed the Shah, and the Ayatollah Khomeini returned to lead an anti-American, repressive theocratic government. I returned to the United States carrying one suitcase of clothing and $1,000. My husband remained in Iran with his wealthy family. He returned to the United States a few years later to start a business with his father’s help, but by then, he was my ex-husband. I had lost my possessions and savings, but my true wealth is portable and remained on my shoulders. I worked as an engineer by day and received an MBA from the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business night program, where I later taught derivatives part time. Just because one is an expert in complicated financial products like derivatives, it does not mean one is good at value investing. (But it doesn’t mean one is bad at it, either.) Although I had read a lot on the subject of value investing, I had not really absorbed it, and I had not diligently practiced it when making investments for my personal portfolio. Then I took a trip to a city 1,269 miles from Wall Street, and my perspective changed. Harry Truman once said: “The only thing new is the history you don’t know.” I thought I knew a lot, until I met Warren Buffett. In June 2005, I received a letter from Warren Buffett inviting me to visit him in Omaha. A few years earlier, I had sent him a copy of a book I wrote on credit derivatives with a letter stuffed between the pages. It was a pleasure to receive his invitation; but I delayed in responding to him, even after learning that lunch with Warren Buffett went for $202,000 in 2004 and $351,000 in 2005 in charity auctions on eBay (the winning bid in 2008 was $2.11 million, and the proceeds benefit the Glide Foundation, a charity dedicated to helping the poor and homeless get back on their feet 1 ). I am glad I didn’t delay our meeting longer because when I finally met Warren Buffett, I came to realize that I still have a lot to learn. Truman is right that we can learn a lot from history (Buffett’s annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders), but Warren Buffett also taught me that I can learn new things about evaluating the present to improve the odds that the future will be better. This book is about my meeting with Warren Buffett on the eve of the greatest market meltdown in history and how meeting him subtly changed the way I look at the global financial markets. I already knew the principles, but meeting Warren encouraged me to think about all financial products in a Benjamin Graham-style framework. I also changed the way I invest. I have no illusions that I am in the same league with Warren Buffett, but I improved after I met him. Buffett’s successful track record spans a half century, so you’ll have to check back with me in fifty years to see how well I performed to use him as a benchmark. But you will have to do the measuring. I don’t measure myself against benchmarks any more than Buffett does. Instead, I focus on value. Benjamin Graham was Warren Buffett’s mentor. Over time, Buffett applied and interpreted Graham’s framework to his own unique investment style.This book is not about Graham’s ideas or Buffett’s ideas, it is about my reinterpretation of my own ideas about the financial markets as I looked through the lens of the value framework of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. My ideas and conclusions are my own and may differ somewhat from Warren Buffett’s. No two people think exactly alike; that is what makes a market. But in areas where we may disagree, I should also point out that Warren Buffett has more experience and a much better track record, and I am still learning. Like him, I consider myself a life-long learner. But unlike Buffett, I have so much more to learn. Monetary wealth is just one measure of value, however. Steven F. Haward, in writing about Winston Churchill, noted the characteristics that set him apart from other men: “candor and plain speaking, decisiveness, the ability to balance attention to details with a view of the wider scene, and a historical imagination that informed his judgment.” 2 I could say the same for Warren Buffett. But I have to add that he has a genuine affection for the human race, and a generous desire for everyone to get as much from life as he does. He shared that with me, and now I am sharing it with you. In the interest of full disclosure, I own Berkshire Hathaway stock (BRKA).",

        "text": "Chapter 1 An Unanswered Invitation Be sure to stop by if you are ever in Omaha and want to talk credit derivatives . . . —Warren Buffett in a letter to Janet Tavakoli, June 6, 2005 I t was August 1, 2005, and I was rereading a letter in my correspondence file dated June 6, 2005.The letter was from Warren Buffett, the CEO of the gargantuan Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. I had not yet responded and had no explanation for the delay save for a little awe. For the several years prior, Fortune listed Warren Buffett as either the richest or second richest man on the planet. He and Bill Gates annually jousted for the top spot, with the outcome depending on the relative share prices of Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft. Several years earlier, I had sent Warren Buffett a copy of my book, Credit Derivatives & Synthetic Structures . In his letter Buffett wrote that he had been looking at the book again and had just found a letter I had tucked between the pages, “Please accept my apologies,” he continued, “for not replying to you when I first received it.” 1 He invited me to stop by if I were ever in Omaha. I looked up. After all this time, I could not remember what I had written in that old letter. I did know that I had not expected a response. But certainly now a response was needed from me, a belated one.“Dear Mr. Buffett,” I began. I am an investor in Berkshire Hathaway “A” shares, but Mr. Buffett would have no way of knowing that since I hold shares in brokerage accounts. Perhaps Mr. Buffett had a bone to pick with me, but I had warned about the risk of credit derivatives and the hidden leverage they created. I was so persistent in exposing the flaws in the financial system that BusinessWeek called me the “Cassandra of credit derivatives.” 2 But most journalists overlooked a much more important derivatives quote in Mr. Buffett’s 2002 shareholder letter. Berkshire Hathaway invests in multinational businesses with a variety of complex operations, and that means that investments have to be hedged or entered into in ways that create tax or accounting advantages. Mr. Buffett had also written:“I sometimes engage in large-scale derivatives transactions.” 3 Yet I dithered and had not responded to his letter. In 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired General Reinsurance. Warren Buffett initially called it his “problem child,” 4 and its General Reinsurance (Gen Re) Securities unit was its problem sibling. Even before the acquisition, both Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman Charlie Munger realized that the value of Gen Re Securities derivatives transactions was overstated and vainly tried to sell it. Some of the contracts were for 20-year maturities, and the operation would take years to wind down. Furthermore, the models valuing the derivatives give poor approximations of the true mark-to-market value—the price at which the derivative can be bought and sold in the market—of some of Gen Re Securities’ esoteric derivatives contracts. There was no real market. Instead, the derivatives contracts were priced or marked based on model valuations known as mark to model. Buffett wrote that in extreme cases, it was a “mark to myth.” 5 In his 2002 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett wrote that it sometimes seemed “madmen” 6 imagined new derivatives contracts. His pique was prompted by the multiyear-long hangover of losses from derivatives, chiefly credit derivatives, in the GenRe Securities unit. It showed a loss of $173 million, partly due to restating faulty, but standard, derivatives accounting from earlier years. The loss inspired Buffett to call derivatives “financial weapons of mass destruction.” 7 His viral sound bite quickly circled the globe. After reading Buffett’s quote in the financial press, one investment banker joked that my book on credit derivatives is “the manual on how to blow up the world.” Warren Buffett’s letter to me arrived in June 2005, a hectic month. One of my clients was a law firm representing a large money center bank as plaintiff in a securities fraud case involving another large money center bank. The defendants’ lawyers had hired a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as their expert witness. Earlier, I had written both my expert opinion report and a report rebutting the former SEC chairman’s point of view. I prepared to give a two-day-long deposition to discuss my opinion in the case in which hundreds of millions of dollars had been lost.The defendants had read my work, knew they faced serious trouble, and subsequently changed their strategy. In fact, they sent their most experienced litigator to depose me. I put Buffett’s letter in my purse to remind myself to respond to it. The morning of the deposition’s first day, I saw the letter and felt a glow of confidence. I am not a superstitious person, but I couldn’t help thinking of the letter as an auspicious sign. I put it in my pending correspondence file and forgot about it again. The deposition came and went, and the plaintiff ’s lawyers were delighted.“Everyone gets bloody in a battle, but you slaughtered them.” The defendants’ arguments fell apart in the face of the facts, and the case never went to trial. Shortly thereafter, the defendants came to a settlement agreement to the plaintiff’s satisfaction. At the end of June, I reviewed my correspondence file and read the letter again. Client business would not take me to Omaha, and I was fairly certain Warren Buffett did not need my help. July 2005 was another busy month: I had focused so much on the securities fraud case that I had a backlog of business, so I took a much-needed week-long vacation to decompress. At the end of July, I reviewed my pending correspondence file, and it contained only one item: the letter. After rereading the letter on August 1, I wrote a letter in reply and offered three dates, with August 25, five days before Warren Buffett’s 75th birthday, being the earliest of the three: It is my turn to apologize for being so late getting back to you. . . . . Business isn’t taking me in that direction anytime soon, but I would be happy to fly in for the day—just because I would enjoy doing it . . . On August 3, I received an e-mail from Warren Buffett through his assistant stating that August 25 would work: If you can make it for lunch, I would be glad to take you to a place with no décor but good food. Everyone in the global financial community knew Warren Buffett by reputation, and his name continually popped up in the financial press, but I operated in specialty niches of the industry, and he was just part of the background noise of my world. I hadn’t read any of the books about him, and I hadn’t read the many articles about Warren Buffett, the man. But I had read many of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports including Mr. Buffett’s shareholder letters, which I enjoyed very much. Warren Buffett was already a billionaire at age 60.That in itself was an achievement beyond the reach of all but a miniscule percentage of humans, but his future success dwarfed that accomplishment. Due to the benefits of continued compounded growth off of a greater base of wealth, the bulk of Buffett’s wealth accumulated after the age when most men retire to spend their money. Throughout my career, I worked with people who eventually met or did business with Warren Buffett. It was as if we attended the same university and he were a popular senior and I a freshman. I was well respected in my field, and was a self-made woman; but Warren Buffett was a financial legend superlatively good at making money for himself and for his shareholders. In 1987,Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger rode to the rescue of John Gutfreund, the CEO of Salomon Brothers. Their “white knight” investment of $700 million of Salomon Inc.’s convertible preferred stock enabled Gutfreund to fend off Ronald Perelman’s hostile takeover. Perelman, a famous, colorful cigar-loving corporate raider with a reputation for ruthlessness, had already swallowed up Revlon, Sunbeam, Panasonic and other companies in the 1980s. In contrast, Buffett and Munger were not well known, and their lifestyles didn’t provide salacious material for the media frenzy that surrounded corporate raiders. Initially, Salomon’s preferred stock was an ideal Berkshire Hathaway investment. Buffett never supplied management; he looked for good honest managers, and he thought he had found one in Gutfreund. Things changed in 1991. Paul Mozer, a trader on the Arbitrage Desk, pleaded guilty to felony charges after a government bond trading scandal. John Meriwether, the head of Salomon’s Arbitrage trading desk, told Gutfreund that Mozer had confessed to him. Their failure to immediately come forward compounded the scandal, and neither of them survived the fallout. Buffett was compelled to protect Berkshire Hathaway’s investment. In the summer of 1991, he became Salomon’s reluctant CEO for 10 months. Mr. Buffett’s leadership and reputation for integrity salvaged Salomon’s business, which rapidly recovered. The convertible bonds outperformed the fixed income securities that Berkshire Hathaway had sold in their place, but by 1995, the option to convert to common shares of Salomon stock was worthless. In 1997, Buffett off loaded the investment on Sandy Weil, and Salomon eventually became a part of Citigroup. I had joined Salomon Brothers’ summer 1985 training class lampooned by my classmate Michael Lewis in his book, Liar’s Poker. Unlike Lewis, I was one of the trainees actually paying attention at the front of the class, but by the time Mr. Buffett served his brief time as CEO, I was no longer working at Salomon Brothers. After almost 20 years working for Wall Street firms in New York and London, I made my living running a Chicago-based consulting business. My clients consider my expertise the product they consume. I had written books on credit derivatives and complex structured finance products, and financial institutions, hedge funds, and sophisticated investors came to me to identify and solve potential problems. Although I was an experienced finance professional, I did not focus on value investing.The University of Chicago was steeped in the myth of efficient markets and leaned to theories put forth by eminent economists.Warren Buffett had earned his MBA at Columbia Business School. He became a friend and disciple of Benjamin Graham, and later worked for Graham’s hedge fund. I had read Security Analysis by Graham and David Dodd in 1985, but I had not actively practiced its principles for my own investment portfolio. Around the same time, I read John Burr Williams’ The Theory of Investment Value, and the fourth edition of The Intelligent Investor. My edition includes an introduction by Warren Buffett with a tribute to the late Benjamin Graham as well as Warren Buffett’s 1984 commencement address at Columbia University titled “The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville.” I remembered both the tribute and the address and reread them in preparation for meeting Mr. Buffett. My focus was chiefly on derivatives and complex securities. While I applied many of the principles of value investing to my analysis of complicated financial products, I did not yet focus on it for my own investments or as a way of looking at the global markets as a whole. Derivatives are financial bets that something will or will not happen. Any financial investment involves a bet, but derivatives are leveraged bets. For very little money down—sometimes no money down—you can make gobs of money (or lose gobs of money). The part about losing gobs of money is something most investors try hard not to think about. Sometimes investment banks selling the products help investors achieve this goal by putting the part about gobs of losses in very fine print buried in hundreds of pages of documents. Leveraged bets are so popular that there is more money at risk in derivatives than in stocks or bonds. The problem with leverage-driven binge banking is that everyone tends to disgorge assets at the same time, depressing market prices. Financial leverage sometimes moves global markets, and if allowed to get out of hand, leverage can theoretically trigger a global market Chernobyl. Warren Buffett disproved the theory of efficient markets that states that prices reflect all known information. His shareholder letters, readily available through Berkshire Hathaway’s Web site, told investors everything they needed to know about mortgage loan fraud, mispriced credit derivatives, and overpriced securitizations, yet this information hid in plain “site.” I knew the financial markets were at great risk—like children playing with matches in a parched forest—but those thoughts were far from my mind on that hot summer morning in 2005 as I boarded the plane for Omaha. I was about to meet a financial legend, the greatest investor who ever lived.",

        "text": "Chapter 2 Lunch with Warren Thanks for sending along the . . . link, which I had not seen.The next guy will probably name his company Buffett, Bernanke and Tavakoli. —Warren Buffett to Janet Tavakoli, August 27, 2007 T he day was sunny and clear, and the flight from Chicago only takes a little over an hour. I wondered how a man with Warren Buffett’s enormous wealth would behave. The late Howard Hughes suffered from paranoid schizophrenia attributed to brain damage suffered during self-piloted plane crashes.According to popular legend, he once roared: “I am not a paranoid deranged millionaire. Godammit . . . I’m a billionaire .” A sense of humor is indispensable if one is insanely rich. My flight got into Omaha two hours before my appointment. I wanted to be on time for lunch.When I told the cab driver the address, he looked confused. I assumed that every taxi driver in Omaha would know the location of Mr. Buffett’s office, but I was wrong. He asked another cab driver for directions, and we were on our way. It was a short ride. The taxi dropped me off at an unremarkable buff-colored office building. I opened the door and entered what appeared to be a hallway instead of a lobby. A lone security guard sat at a small desk. He seemed to be expecting me, telling me to go right on up to the 14th floor. An elevator was already on the ground floor, and there was no one else in the lobby. I rode up alone. The elevator doors opened to a vacant hallway. As I stepped off the elevator, I was startled to hear a friendly female voice say: “Janet, make a right and then another right, and go straight ahead.” I quickly looked around. There was no one there, and I didn’t see a camera or a speaker. I did a quick mental review of my actions since entering the building and was relieved I hadn’t adjusted my skirt on the elevator. The voice repeated the instructions, and this time I followed them. One of Warren Buffett’s assistants sat to the right of the small reception area. There was no one else there. I told her I had arrived early, but I planned to read Paul Erdman’s book Tug of War about the global currency crisis in the mid-1990s. She offered me beverages, and I accepted a glass of water. I had barely taken a sip, when Warren Buffett appeared. He gave me a quick look and said energetically:“Oh, Janet’s here. Show her right in.” Warren Buffett was taller and trimmer than I expected. He later told me he works out with a trainer three times per week. His famous eyebrows were trimmed—unlike an old Internet photo—and his skin glowed as if freshly scrubbed. He wore a light gray suit and looked as if he dressed for comfort and appropriateness rather than to impress. He invited me to sit on a sofa while he took a neighboring chair. Plump beads of sweat rolled down my water glass, and I looked around his coffee table in consternation for a coaster or an ash tray. I didn’t want to be known as the person who left a blistering water ring on the smooth surface. Oh that? A calling card from Janet Tavakoli . Noticing my hesitation, Warren retrieved the Wall Street Journal from his desk. He set it down, and said I could put my glass on his paper. I looked down at the paper knowing I was about to make a mess of it. It looked so smooth.Warren Buffett had worked as a paper boy for the Buffalo News and identified the Washington Post as one of the great bargains of the twentieth century for Berkshire Hathaway’s investors. Warren’s love of newspapers is well known, and for more than half a century he has been a loyal reader of the Wall Street Journal . My heart sank at the thought of making a mess of his paper. Had he finished reading it? I looked up, and to my complete surprise, Warren Buffett appeared nervous. He wouldn’t feel comfortable until I accepted his offer of hospitality; he couldn’t relax until I relaxed. I rested my glass and sat down, smiling inwardly. Then I blundered. In an awkward attempt to lighten the moment, I said:“Some days that is all the Wall Street Journal is good for.” His head snapped around and he gave me a sharp look. A few seconds passed.“I agree,” he finally said. But I knew he didn’t mean his comment, and I hadn’t meant mine. What’s more, he knew I didn’t mean it, and I suspected he knew that I knew he didn’t mean his. Judith Martin, the Washington Post’s etiquette columnist, maintains etiquette has been given a bad name by strangers using fake familiarity to make demands on our time, our privacy, and our resources. Genuine etiquette is a useful social tool designed to make others comfortable without sacrificing one’s own rights. Months later, Warren wrote me that he didn’t think he had “studied her advice sufficiently,” but I thought he graduated summa cum laude . The Wall Street Journal sparked a discussion of how the news media has changed. Stock price quotations are almost instantaneous. There is more financial news today than ever before originating from a wider variety of sources including the Internet. Warren loves newspapers, recognizing that newspaper ownership confers status and influence out of proportion with economic gain, yet run properly there is also a lot of economic gain to be had. As he talked, Warren mentioned Kay. Kay? My mind raced. Who is Kay? Fortunately, I quickly realized that Warren meant the late Katherine Graham, president and publisher of the Washington Post . Warren said she was “great lady,” a “remarkable woman,” and recommended I read Personal History , her Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography. With Kay’s sponsorship and his substantial ownership position, Warren became a board member of the iconic Washington Post . He said she was the least confident person he had ever met, a curious fact given her privileged life, social standing, and accomplishments. In Personal History , Katherine Graham expresses admiration for Warren and expresses her gratitude to him for the tutelage he gave her in financial matters. She relied on him for both professional and personal support, and his mentor-ship was a source of strength, giving her confidence. The otherwise all-male board was initially wary of their friendship and she noticed some sexism: “Tom Murphy [another member of the Washington Post ’s Board of Directors] could consult Warren and no one questioned him, but if I consulted him, it seemed to be something threatening and sinister.” 1 Often, when men and women have a close business relationship, it is characterized as a Mephistophelean bargain, but when men form a close business relationship, it is just business. Ms. Graham also noticed: “As Warren and I started to spend more and more time together, people’s eyebrows shot up, and I was young enough then for our relationship to become quite an issue.” 2 Even a woman of Katherine Graham’s stature and maturity—she was 13 years older than Warren—could not escape petty innuendo; but she did not let it deter her from taking advantage of Warren’s expertise or spoil her appreciation of their friendship. I could well imagine Warren’s companionable appeal to Katherine Graham, and Warren lights up when he reminisces about Ms. Graham. He seems to enjoy women without enjoying them too much. It is the difference between spending time with an art connoisseur and a cat burglar. One makes you feel as if you are a national treasure; the other makes you feel as if you are about to be snatched and stuffed in a bag, never to be heard from again. For his part, Warren says he admired Kay’s courage and persistence. Warren recognizes that the news business had changed. He said the Wall Street Journal threw away a golden opportunity to dominate Internet business news. Internet financial news is both instantaneous and less reliable. Newspaper and magazines—even the online versions of legacy print media—often lag behind blogs and certain specialty new services. There are a handful of Internet financial journalists who are every bit as good as the best reporters in the print media, but they are scattered all over the Internet. Matthew Currier Burden wrote a book about this phenomenon: The Blog of War . The military is having difficulty containing sensitive information as soldiers pour out their stories over the Internet.The day after our lunch, I sent Warren an article written by John Hockenberry, “In Iraq for 365,” from Wired.com . Warren wrote back that he found the blogs on Iraq particularly interesting along with “the potential that it has for changing journalism.” The blogs of soldiers in Iraq are much more informative than any state-side news media, including television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and other Internet news sources. Warren is keenly interested in that.Traditional channels of information are being bypassed and passed up by direct information from the front lines, something that had never happened before the Internet Age.The accounts from soldiers are more compelling and informed than the so-called “professional” reportage from mainstream media. I mentioned that Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart often has better news analysis than what tries to pass as news shows on other channels. Warren hadn’t watched the program, but asked if he should. I said Stewart’s interviews of leading world figures might be of interest, and later occasionally sent a link. Warren had not yet gotten around to getting a TiVO. Neither had I. Warren displays an open mind to all new ideas. Warren and I both love our newspapers, but we love news more, wherever we find it. The challenge is to find reliable news. I was about to discover that some of the information I had read about Warren Buffett was incorrect, and the coming years would reveal more inaccuracies. Dustin Hoffman once remarked on a story he read about how he and Tom Cruise were holding up shooting because they were a couple of prima donnas. The story was fabricated: “but if I wasn’t making a movie with him and I just picked up the paper, I’d believe it. That’s interesting, isn’t it?” 3 There is a reason we call it the “Information Age,” not the “Age of Wisdom.” Financial research often ends where the Internet begins. Articles are frequently incorrect, urban legend is sometimes presented as fact, and trivial errors sometimes become viral financial lore. Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett’s Columbia School professor and mentor, founded a hedge fund in the 1920s. Warren says that Graham’s hedge fund was the earliest as far as he knows, though there may have been another before it. Yet, most media report that the first hedge fund founded in the United States was done so in 1949 by A. W. Jones. 4 Financial journalists rarely mention Benjamin Graham’s fund. Apparently there are no Google references to the 1920s. On a televised talk show, Ben Bradlee, vice president and managing editor of the Washington Post , held that he didn’t think newspapers would ever be supplanted by the Internet. Some Internet sources are excellent, but it is still unclear if they can make enough revenue to continue putting out quality information, and new competitors keep popping up on the Web. He is probably correct that there will always be a demand for newspapers; but newspaper revenues are already being partially supplanted as they lose chunks of lucrative classified ad revenues to the Internet. Unlike Bradlee, Warren does not let nostalgia get in the way of a good business strategy. On November 21, 2005, Cathy Baron Tamraz, the founder of Business Wire, a San Francisco-based distributor of online press releases, sent Warren a letter in which she told him, “We run a tight ship and keep spending under wraps . . .” She describes a business with no secretaries or management layers, and they invest most of what they have to stay abreast of technology. By the time he finished reading the letter,Warren had decided to acquire a business perfect for his investment style: it has dedicated management, eliminates unnecessary overhead, produces a product people need and has huge potential for revenue growth. By March 2006, Warren had closed the deal, making Business Wire, an Internet phenomenon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. An assistant handles Warren’s e-mail. This is because Warren molds technology to his lifestyle rather than letting it mold him. He joked that Bill Gates offered to send him an attractive young female computer expert to show him the ropes.Warren, however, is quite comfortable with the computer. He plays hours of online bridge, and he asked me about my bridge-playing skills: “Do you play online?” Warren encouraged me to, but I like to see the other players. I responded: “Audrey Grant, a master bridge player I met, says bridge is about luck, skill, and your relationship with your partner. I like to hear the bidding with all the inflections.” At the mention of Audrey Grant,Warren’s eyes twinkled with delight; he knows her. I had already told him “Tavakoli” is my ex-husband’s name, and Warren asked: “Have you read Audrey’s nonbridge book, Ex Etiquette? ” No? He jumped up and called out to his assistant: “Let’s buy Janet that book!”We walked to his assistant’s desk and she searched Amazon. The book had been published in 1988 and was out of print. Undeterred, Warren had his assistant order it from the used books option to be delivered to me at a later date. (I saw Audrey again in July 2006, when she came to Chicago to give a bridge lesson. After I handed her the book to sign, she flipped it over in confusion, having completely forgotten it. She no longer even had a copy of her own and was astonished that Warren remembered it.) I was not prepared for Warren. I am accustomed to a business world in which most of the men are not “nice kids,” and I have long been used to prudently dealing with disrespect by lesser men (not twice). If Warren had simply avoided overt rudeness, it would have been an upgrade from most finance professionals, and it would have given me bragging rights: I met Warren Buffett, and he was civil! It is hard to explain how Mr. Buffett managed to thoroughly win me over. He seemed to look away for an instant and then looked back with an almost imperceptible nod. It was as if he considered the totality of his impressive experience, and then concentrated on me with a compelling bias in my favor—as if he had exactly the impression of me, that at my personal best, I hoped to impart. In that moment, Mr. Buffett became Warren and seemed to convey that I should believe in myself the way he believed in me. It seemed as if our conversation up until now had been a test drive. Warren trotted out his well-worn clichés reported over the years in magazine articles. Now he picked up the pace and asked a lot of questions. We must have covered over one hundred topics. I lived in Iran for a year? Warren met Farah Diba, the late shah of Iran’s third wife, at a Washington dinner party. I am grateful to be back, grateful for the opportunities, and relieved to again enjoy my rights as a woman born in the United States? So was Rosa Blumkin, the Jewish Russian emigrant furniture sales entrepreneur who sold her business to Warren and died at the age of 104. Inspired by his late wife, Susie, Warren is a major supporter of Planned Parenthood and a woman’s right to choose. I do most of my work out of my home office? Warren likes the idea of keeping overhead low, especially since I rent conference offices when needed—he had worked out of his home office for years running his first highly successful investment partnership. I wear casual clothes to work unless I am meeting clients? Warren had considered that, too, but in his position as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, it isn’t practical. I attended a fundraiser in Chicago and met Ted Kennedy? Warren knows Ted Kennedy, but on a much different plane. I read Forbes ? Warren knew the late Malcolm Forbes, son of the magazine’s founder, B. C. Forbes. California housing and politics? Warren had advised Arnold Schwarzenegger, and another of Warren’s personal friends was throwing him a birthday party in California, where Warren has a house. I had worked my way through my MBA as a chemical engineer? A chemical engineer and his wife, Donald and Mildred Othmer, had invested $50,000 with Warren in the 1960s and it was worth $750 million when Mr. Othmer died in 1995 (Mildred Othmer died in 1998. Today their holdings would be worth more than $3 billion). I was born in Chicago? Warren had owned and later sold retail stores in parts of town I probably didn’t visit. I think the rating agencies’ opinions are unreliable? Warren doesn’t rely on them either for his investment decisions. Derivatives sometimes present opportunities? Warren had taken on a large derivative position on the dollar weakening (and later reduced it and put on another). I know large business owners? Warren is looking for good foreign businesses—preferably family owned—of $1 billion or more in size. When Matteo Ricci studied at the Jesuit College in Rome in the late 1500s, he created a memory palace in his mind. Each item in the palace represents a series of concepts. The rooms and locations within the palace serve as directories and files do on a computer. Ricci later rose to elevated status in Ming dynasty society, because he was able to instantaneously learn, retain, and retrieve hundreds of new Chinese kanji to the astonished delight of the Chinese nobles. I felt as if Warren were giving me a private tour of his memory palace. As we conversed,Warren seemed to find new knickknacks to place on a memory mantelpiece. Aristotle believed a trained memory is essential for developing logical thought processes. Warren does not rely on finance nursery rhymes like “diversification reduces risk,” in fact, he often rejects them in favor of logic. Renowned professors like Yale’s Benoit Mandelbrot urge investors to broadly diversify as a way around the fear and greed driven fluctuations of what Benjamin Graham called the manic depressive “Mr. Market.” 5 Mandelbrot, who popularized fractals, seems resigned: “It is, in my view, premature to be hoping for serious gains from fractal finance.There is still too much we do not know.” 6 Mandelbrot is correct about fractal finance, but he might be surprised to learn that Warren Buffett is not a big fan of diversification for the sake of it. Diversification does not guarantee that you will not lose money; it only makes it less likely you will lose it all at once. Warren is a fan of index funds for people who want low fees, want to invest in the market, and do not have the time or inclination to learn about companies. But diversification simply for the sake of it is false prudence. By ignoring discrete risks, diversification can unnecessarily add risk to an investor’s portfolio. Like all defensive strategies, diversification is most effective if you understand what you are defending against. Warren advocates diversifying only into assets you understand well. Highly skilled managers diversify less and perform better than less skilled managers. Warren seeks investments with a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry run by decision makers with a “here-today, here-forever” outlook. Warren does not discriminate between value companies and growth companies; he looks for businesses that throw off tremendous cash flows and have high revenue growth potential. Warren is delighted when the market hands him a good company at a cheap price, but he is content to buy a good company at a fair price. At the time we met, Warren trounced both “growth” and “value” managers. According to Sandford C. Bernstein, Inc.’s mutual fund performance results from 1969 to 2004, value managers outperformed growth managers. Berkshire Hathaway handily beat both growth and value managers. For example, Berkshire Hathaway’s annualized return for the period 1969-2004 was 24.1 percent versus only 12.3 percent for the value managers; it beat value managers by 11.8 percent on an annualized basis. Any way one sliced the time periods, Berkshire Hathaway’s performance far exceeded the mutual funds ( Table 2.1 ). Table 2.1 Total Return BRKA vs. Growth and Value Managers Source: Sanford C. Bernstein, Inc., Strategic and Quantitative Research Grp.;Tavakoli Structured Finance,Yahoo! Finance. The Yale Endowment, headed by David Swensen, might be a better comparison.Yale is renowned for its investment acumen, ranking in the top one percent of large institutional investors. In the 10-year period ending June 30, 2003,Yale’s private equity investments earned 36 percent annually, chiefly due to its venture capital investments. But the overall Yale portfolio earned 16.0 percent, and during the same 10-year period Berkshire Hathaway returned 16.8 percent. (From June 20, 2003 to June 29, 2007, Yale had annualized returns of 23 percent; Berkshire Hathaway had annualized returns of 10.8 percent for the same time period.) The average individual investor does not have access to Yale’s tax-exempt endowment but can purchase Berkshire Hathaway’s tax-efficient equity on the open market. Moreover,Yale is considerably smaller than Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway produced higher sustained returns on a portfolio that was huge in comparison to Yale. Warren feels it is easier to produce higher returns with less money under management.Yale had only $11 billion in assets, whereas Berkshire Hathaway had almost $173 billion in assets at the end of June 30, 2003. 7 I suggested one might use a computer program to sort data, identify companies that have a low price-to-earnings ratio and a high return on assets, and then look for value from the companies that make the cut. Warren said: “No, I don’t do that.” I repeated that it might save time to sort this way, thinking of my own portfolio. Time slowed, and Warren’s eyes seemed to darken as he silently watched me. It was as if we had been jogging, and I had suddenly stopped to tie my shoes. He was waiting for me. It isn’t ideal to have to stop for a running partner, but if they can keep pace with you, you jog in place and wait. I opened a familiar door in my memory. What had Benjamin Graham said? If you want a “MARGIN OF SAFETY,” 8 the business’s past ability to generate earnings well in excess of all requirements (including interest on debt) protects investors if there is an unforeseeable problem that causes future net income to decline. But Graham was not a fan of arbitrary metrics. A stock is not a good investment just because it is trading near its asset value—a nice price tag is not enough. The enterprise has to be in a strong business position relative to competitors, have a strong financial position (low or very manageable debt), and has to have good management (no ratio can tell you that).The business’s favorable long-term economics includes a “satisfactory ratio of earnings to price . . . and its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.” 9 Benjamin Graham did not distinguish between “value” stocks and “growth” stocks. He knew that value and growth are inseparable. I finally grasped what Warren was saying. Warren has such a wide body of knowledge that he does not need to rely on “systems.” His further point was that I do not have to, either. I read the financial reports of each corporation, and high return on assets and low P/E ratios can be temporary distortions that do not necessarily indicate financial health. I have enough experience to identify opportunities myself. Thump! I threw a pair of crutches that I clearly didn’t need out of a window of my mental memory palace . Warren’s vast knowledge of corporations and their finances helps him identify derivatives opportunities, too. He only participates in the derivatives markets when Wall Street gets it wrong and prices derivatives incorrectly. Warren tells everyone that he only does certain derivatives transactions when they are mispriced . He even states this in his shareholder letters. He plays fair and doesn’t seek to take advantage of anyone; he warns Wall Street that if they are trading with him, they got the price wrong. I was aware of this, but it did not really sink in until I met him. Looking back, I may not have actually believed it until I met him. He cheerfully filled me in. Warren says “everyone [in the finance business] has an IQ of at least 140”— I imagined a disintegrator in the elevator that measures and eliminates those who did not meet the threshold (and I had only worried about adjusting my skirt) —but a high IQ is not necessary to be a good investor. Warren is a highly intelligent polymath, but does not credit his investment success to that fact. Consistently following basic financial principles is much more important. Charlie Munger, his long-time partner, tells Warren that the challenge both of them have is staying anchored. Warren takes advantage of the fact that many Wall Street derivatives traders construct trading models with no clear idea of what they are doing. I know investment bank modelers with advanced math and science degrees who have never read the financial statements of the corporate credits they model. That is true of some credit derivatives traders, too. The global business has grown too fast, and there is a dearth of essential experience. Modelers manipulate a large body of data, without knowing how to interpret the results. Warren maintains that long dated (15- or 20-year maturity) equity index puts on the FTSE (a UK stock index) and the DOW, among other indexes, are mispriced. Investment banks price the options based on volatility, irrespective of the absolute level of the indexes. Investment banks enter into these very long-dated put options struck at the market—today’s market level—and they are European puts, exercisable only once—at the expiration date many years in the future. Most of the option models assume that prices vary around today’s level, and the models do not take into account the probable growth of the economy. Even if a model takes growth into account, it usually woefully underestimates it along with the future value of the stock market. This is a common error, and when Warren finds someone willing to do these mispriced trades with him in size, he jumps on the opportunity. Options are a natural fit for insurance companies that are part of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. When Warren sells a put buyer the right to make him pay a specific price agreed today for the stock index (no matter what its value 20 years from now), Warren receives a premium. Berkshire Hathaway gets to invest that money for 20 years. Warren thinks the buyer, the investment bank, is paying him too much. The stock index could have a lower than today’s market price (fat chance), but unless there is a global economic disaster, it is highly unlikely. Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway invests the premiums that will in all likelihood cover anything it might need to pay out, and it is most likely, it will never pay out anything at all, since the stock index is likely to be higher than today’s value. It is as if the models were predicting the future net worth of an entire Harvard MBA class based on their first job out of school. It is possible they won’t be worth more in 20 years, but it isn’t likely, since their earning power is likely to rapidly grow. Warren doesn’t need a complex option model to tell him that the options are mispriced; he only has to look at the strike price, the proposed level of the index, to know that the other guy’s model is wrong. Warren takes large upfront premiums in exchange for agreeing to make a payment in 15 or 20 years that in all probability will never need to be made. In the meantime, he employs the cash premiums for the benefit of Berkshire Hathaway. In the 2007 shareholder letter, Warren told shareholders: “We have received premiums of $4.5 billion, and we recorded a liability at year end of $4.6 billion.” Another winning feature of this trade is that Berkshire Hathaway has zero credit risk. In the unlikely event that a payment is made 20 years from now, the put buyer is relying on Berkshire Hathaway to make a payment. Berkshire Hathaway is not depending upon an investment bank to make him a payment if the market is so troubled that stock index level is below today’s level; an investment bank would probably be wiped out. Berkshire Hathaway, on the other hand, is likely to be doing much better than other companies in that scenario. Even the required payment on the put option in 20 years will be buffered by the fact that it is only a small part of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio and it is partially offset by the value of the premiums in 20 years. Warren also noticed that credit derivatives are often mispriced. When this occurs, he earns upfront premiums for taking default risk on baskets of high-yield ( junk) bonds. When junk bond yields are very high and most investors avoid them,Warren will enter the market when he can be handsomely compensated to take the risk of carefully chosen companies. Warren invests when the prices are right; but he is happy to do nothing for years when the price for the risk is not right. Warren is aided by the fact that most investment banks use sophisticated Monte Carlo models that misprice the transactions. Some of the models rely on rating agency inputs, and the rating agencies do a poor job of rating junk debt. Ratings guru Arturo Cifuentes, a managing director at R.W. Pressprich & Co., is one of the original developers of Moody’s collateralized debt obligations (CDO) model. Among other serious problems, he notes that Moody’s released a report in 2005 (and again in 2006) that shows that when judged by impairment rate, there is no difference in performance between CDO tranches with a junk rating of BB- and those with an investment-grade rating of BBB. 10 Other models rely on the relationships between historical market prices or on historical yield spread data. If you play with coins or dice, you can learn a lot about the outcomes by flipping and throwing them thousands of times and recording the results. A Monte Carlo simulation uses a computer to throw a whole lot of random inputs into a model. It is like shaking a newly made chair to see how stable it is. Financial firms use correlation models to look at what happens when corporations default.The model tries to determine if other companies will behave similarly when one company strengthens or weakens. The models are highly unstable. They are like a chair that collapses beneath you as soon as you sit on it. Small changes to model inputs result in huge changes to the results. If you play with coins or dice, you know exactly what your inputs are and you can model all potential outcomes. You can examine the coins (heads or tails per coin), and you can model all of the possible outcomes.You can examine dice (one to six dots on each face of each cube), and again, a mathematical model can describe all potential outcomes. We do not have to guess at the inputs for dice and cards; they are known in advance and the relationship between the inputs does not change, even though we may use a Monte Carlo model to randomize the inputs (the flips and tosses). The inputs to credit models are a bit of a guess, since we rely on data approximations to come up with the inputs in the first place. Furthermore, the relationships between the inputs can change. Most of the data describing how one corporation behaves in relationship to another is based on market prices such as stock prices or the prices of credit default swaps based on corporate debt. Moreover, there is very little of this already-suspect data to work with. The results are guesses about relative price or yield spread movements, which result in a guess about the correlations. When a credit upset occurs in a financial sector, correlations that were previously fractional numbers tend to converge to one. Everything seems to fall apart at once. A model will calculate the wrong answer to nine decimal places, but it cannot tell you it is the wrong answer. The biggest problem with the models is that even if they temporarily get the correct answer, they do not tell you what you need to know. Wall Street estimates asset correlations instead of the necessary default correlations. Furthermore, the overwhelming flaw in the methodology is that if you want to make up a default correlation between two companies, you must make the false assumption that default probability does not vary, but of course it does. Even if the models measured the default probability of individual companies—and they do not—if a company defaults, you still have to guess the recovery rate, the amount left over, if any, after all obligations are paid. You cannot solve for two independent items of information from a single piece of information such as a letter grade or a price. You cannot get both the probability that a company will default and the amount of money you will have left if it does default. Warren warns Wall Street it is about to get into a fight it cannot win, and Wall Street comes anyway. The models are incapable of generating the information Warren has in his head. Warren says he doesn’t use a model, but he does. Warren himself is the model. He has spent so much time reading annual reports that he has a good idea of whether or not a company will default, and if it does, how much will be leftover after everyone else is paid off. Moreover, he knows how businesses affect each other and how the impact may change in a variety of scenarios. He is much faster and much more accurate than a misguided computer model. Warren does not rely on a price since that is what you pay. He relies on value because that is what you get . Unlike the computer models, Warren does not guess at the inputs. He does not use a potentially irrational price as his input.Warren sizes up each business and relies on his rational assessment of value. A couple of years before I met Warren, a Wall Street firm paid Berkshire Hathaway to take the risk of the first corporation to default in a basket of junk debt.Warren only considers deals he knows are mispriced, and he has a couple of conditions. He chooses the specific corporate names; he refuses “diversified” portfolios containing a large number of corporations. He does trades in massive size—$100 million or more, if possible . The following is a simplified example. If one of a handful of pre-chosen corporations defaults, Berkshire Hathaway pays the original full amount for the debt, which is 100 percent of the first corporate name to default. Berkshire Hathaway then gets the recovery value—the market price of the debt.This price will depend on the remaining value of the company. Warren happily enters this type of credit derivative trade, when he can create a margin of safety—when Wall Street pays him so handsomely in an upfront premium that it exceeds anything he might lose if one of the companies defaults. When Collins & Aikman defaulted and filed for bankruptcy in June 2005, Berkshire Hathaway recovered 35¢ on the dollar, or put another way, it “lost” 65¢ on the dollar. David Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget during President Ronald Reagan’s administration, was Collins & Aikman’s CEO and stepped down the week before the bankruptcy was announced. In March 2007, he and other top officers were charged by a New York federal grand jury with conspiracy, several counts of fraud, and obstruction of justice. Allegations are that, among other things, loans were disguised as revenues and revenue was booked before it was earned. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said: “They resorted to lies, tricks and fraud.” 11 Warren’s margin of safety greatly increases the likelihood he will make money, even when an unexpected event like this occurs. It is more important to have a margin of safety to protect oneself against a Black Bart—someone fancying himself to be an offspring of the famous Wells Fargo stagecoach robber—than a rare Black Swan type market event. Berkshire’s “loss,” given that the Collins & Aikman default occurred, was 65¢ on the dollar, but Berkshire had received much more than 65¢ on the dollar in upfront premiums. On average, Berkshire Hathaway had taken in around 75¢ on the dollar in upfront premiums. Warren does these trades in very large size. For example for every $1 billion of transactions, Berkshire stands to lock in $100 million (or more), if there is a default. Meanwhile, it has the use of $750 million in premium money it puts to good use. In 2005, Warren had $1.5 billion in premiums to put to work. Isn’t that adorable? Normally, first to default trades are viewed as the riskiest trades, and junk debt is viewed as the riskiest kind of asset; but Warren builds in a margin of safety that makes this a wise investment as long as Wall Street misprices the risk.Warren Buffett has figured out the safest way to take junk risk in the history of junk debt. Investment banks could put on the same trades if they did fundamental analysis of the underlying companies, but they are too busy playing with correlation models. Banks and investment banks have become invisible hedge funds putting risk on their balance sheets that they cannot quantify. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett models the risk in his head and profits. Warren has another advantage: Wall Street underestimates him. In the fall of 2006, I was talking to a friend in New York, and I mentioned that Warren Buffett and I have similar views on credit derivatives, and—now comes the bragging part—I had met Warren Buffett. The problem with bragging is that it often backfires. This was one of those times. My former colleague, a Wall Street structured products “correlation” trader, wrinkled his nose and sniffed: “ That old guy ? He hates derivatives.” Warren continues to give Wall Street fair warning. In that way, Warren is like Ronald Reagan, who said during his presidential campaign debate with Mondale that he refused to make age an issue:“I will not exploit my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” By now we were past hungry, and Warren drove the few miles to the restaurant. We discussed some of the personalities I had dealt with when I started my business. Vetting new people takes a lot of time, so I only deal with people I have worked with in the past or who have solid referrals. Clients who know me meet my terms of business. Early on, a large famous pension fund used a ruse claiming it wanted consulting services; all it really wanted was a two-hour conference call with its management, during which it garnered valuable information.That is bad enough, but a consultant loses twice when insult is added to injury. When people owe you a moral debt but do not have a legal obligation, you will get nothing—and worse—they will demean you to suppress their guilt. In contrast, when a client pays a nonrefundable upfront retainer, the client—having already acknowledged your value—rolls out the red carpet. Everyone shows up on time for meetings. Warren commented that I am in a position that I should not have to deal with difficult people. There are so many good people to work with that it isn’t necessary to spend time with those who do not recognize the value of my services. I had independently come to the same conclusion, but had not decisively acted on it. Warren said the right words at the right time, and furthermore, the words came from the right person. Crash! I tossed a piece of old and heavy baggage out the window of a musty attic in my memory palace . When we entered the restaurant, the rest of the diners seemed not to notice us, presumably accustomed to seeing Warren Buffett at lunch. We sat down to a meal of roast beef and mashed potatoes. I had already mentioned to Warren that I take thyroid medication and a careful diet helps maintain balance, so I ordered water. The popular press talks about Warren’s love of Cherry Coke. Warren famously asks people to have a Coke—even if they just open it and do not drink it—since “we make money on every twelfth can.” At the May 2007 annual meeting, Warren showed a comedy film skit with LeBron James in which he admonished James: “You will drink Coke.” Perhaps in deference to not having something his guest was not having, Warren ordered water, too. If you must have water, make sure it is Dasani, a Coca-Cola product . While we discussed not wasting time with people who don’t recognize your value, Warren asked me what I was doing for my personal account. There is a real opportunity cost to dealing with difficult people above and beyond the immediate drain of time and energy. One could be using the time to identify investment opportunities. I am at a stage where I can lose more money in forgone opportunities than I can make on certain types of client work. Warren seems to feel there is nothing stopping me; I have critical mass. A couple of years after our lunch, I sent Warren a link to a firm that seemed to be borrowing famous names—including Berkshire’s—to lend credibility to its activities. Warren responded that next time they would borrow “Buffett, Bernanke, and Tavakoli.” 12 Warren inspires confidence, and his attitude has shifted my own. While it is true that connections bring investment opportunities to one’s door, and men have a much easier time raising money to manage than women in the gender-biased finance world, there are ways around that. Warren was an unknown in the financial world when he began, and I already have a network of contacts. Warren started out with much less money than I have in my own portfolio. In fact, not drawing attention to one’s trades is an advantage, as long as one stays out of the way of short sellers. “Mr. Market” might be a manic depressive, but he is an equal opportunity manic depressive. The global market does not care what your name is or who you know. It does not care about ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender, or age. Warren’s interests are not limited to the market, however. Warren has another rare skill: He is an accomplished gossip. Quality gossip is first-hand information about someone interesting, but the gossip should not be of interest to the authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. It has to be known to enough people that it cannot be easily traced back to you because, if those you gossip about know you are doing it, you will be slightly embarrassed. Yet, it isn’t as if the person you are passing it along to couldn’t have found it out anyway with enough diligent digging. Warren told me some background about a famous American family—albeit one I did not know personally—and steps they had taken for money. “But surely they didn’t need the money,” I protested in surprise. He paused and his eyes flashed with conspiratorial delight, then he nodded with a knowing smile. As fate would have it, Warren’s gossip earned extra bonus points many months later when I had dealings with the son of the famous patriarch. Now, that is great gossip . Warren had given me much more value during this meeting than I had given him, but I did not grab the check—he had asked me to lunch. This news will dismay his detractors, who seem to have concluded that because Warren doesn’t spend his money the way they would spend it—feeding their vanity and lording it over the less fortunate—Warren must live like a miser. Yet it seems to me Warren lives a great life while being subject to the same curve balls life throws all of us. He has loyal and happy employees and investors, a loving home life, a stimulating business, and access to anyone on the planet. He has the means to take a private jet to Las Vegas for an afternoon of poker or was able to fly to the bedside of his late wife every weekend during months of chemotherapy treatments. He has created enough wealth to live well and leave a legacy that could make a lasting difference in the lives of many others. He lives his life according to what is most important to him, and he has created the means to do it. Don’t tell his detractors, they will just find someone else to complain about . As we drove back to the office, Warren reminisced about Rosa Blumkin, whose retail furniture business Berkshire Hathaway had invested in years ago. She was a Russian Jew and evaluated people by sizing up whether or not they would hide her if it ever came to that. Trust was very important to her. I think trust is important, too, but sometimes you have to be the one willing to step up and hide someone else.Warren also mentioned that I should not neglect my love life, since that is the most important thing, as far as he is concerned. He did not discuss his personal life, other than to talk about his late wife, Susie. He was then living with his long-time companion, Astrid, whom he married on his 76th birthday. A year after our lunch, I saw his late wife Susie in a brief clip on a Charlie Rose interview with Warren, after he had just announced that—over time—he was giving away the major part of his fortune to the Gates Foundation for charitable works.Warren sent me a CD of the original full-length interview from which the clip had been taken with a note that it captured her in depth: “After you have viewed it, I would appreciate it if you would return the copy to me.” When I returned the copy, I sent a note: Susie’s interview is the good news that you are loved . . . Susie struck me as a very happy woman. Bertrand Russell described how he achieved personal happiness: “Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.” He could have been writing about your Susie. Although he is giving away most of his fortune, Warren has provided for his family. For years he said he would not leave them his fortune. Instead, he will leave them fortunate. He will provide ample funding for charitable organizations run by his children. Not only does that give them a social status and control over their lives that would be difficult to achieve in a typical corporate job, they have the opportunity to maintain self-esteem by doing important work. Warren’s wife will also want for nothing, and when one interviewer recently asked Warren to name his hero, he immediately responded:“My wife.” When we arrived back at the office, Warren showed me a copy of his son Howard’s book of photographs capturing unforgettable faces of people living in the Third World. Warren assumed a poker face, saying, “He has really developed.” Afterwards,Warren gave me a tour of his offices and showed his gallery of letters, stopping to explain the background of some of his favorite mementos. Warren and I met for more than four hours. By the time Warren’s assistant organized a taxi to take me to the airport, I had a lot to think about. It was time to make subtle shifts in the way I looked at my business and my personal portfolio, and from my point of view, it was well worth the trip. As for Warren, he was doing his job. Berkshire Hathaway’s success means that Warren has billions of dollars he needs to invest, and he needs transactions of massive size. Several times during the course of the day, Warren repeated that if I found a large-sized investment opportunity in a company that meets his criteria—$1 billion or more in size—to bring it to him. He also asked me to call him. The flipside of that coin is knowing what not to buy. Another feature of Berkshire Hathaway is that, unlike hedge funds, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger eschew leverage, avoiding companies burdened with debt. If you are not leveraged, and your businesses generate enough cash to meet your expenses, you do not have to worry about what anyone else thinks of your financial situation.You never have to sell assets into a distressed market to raise money, and if the stock market closes for years, you do not need to worry, since your assets keep growing and generating value. Warren and Charlie know they could have had higher historical returns had they used leverage, but in a distressed market, one can obliterate a great track record by destroying shareholder capital. When calculating compounded returns, the game is over and your track record is irrelevant if you multiply by zero. We both knew the market was overleveraged, rating agencies misrated debt, and investment banking models were incorrect, but neither Warren nor I was aware that day that our interests would become more closely aligned as the largest financial debacle in the history of the capital markets began to unfold. Both Warren and I knew the financial markets were overleveraged and credit derivatives contributed to the excessive leverage. Things were still relatively calm as I boarded the plane home in August 2005, but financial warning lights flashed bright red. Archimedes, the ancient Greek inventor and scientist, had said that if you gave him enough leverage, he could move the world. The global markets had combined high leverage with bad lending practices, and the financial world would soon feel the negative force.",

        "text": "Chapter 3 The Prairie Princes versus the Princes of Darkness Bravo! Your Golden Fleece Award is a gem. —Warren Buffett to Janet Tavakoli, October 2, 2006 B oth Warren Buffett and I advocate treating employee stock options as a cost of doing business.Warren operates in a competitive marketplace, and he has no problem compensating employees well. This cost of doing business should be calculated correctly and it should be expensed. Stock options are not an issue when Berkshire Hathaway finds a well-run family-owned business to purchase; if Berkshire Hathaway buys shares of stock in the marketplace, however, stock options are difficult to avoid. For example, Berkshire Hathaway has owned shares of Coca-Cola since 1988 (8.6 percent of Coca-Cola shares as of the end of 2007) 1 , but Coca-Cola did not start expensing employee stock options until 2002. 2 In his 1985 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett challenged the CEOs of corporate America. He offered to pay a substantial cash sum to any executive granted a restricted stock option in exchange for the right to any future gain the executive might realize. Stock options are a real cost of doing business.You say you cannot value them? Great! I’ll pay cash for them. Now try to explain to your shareholders how this cash didn’t just come out of their pocket and move into yours. Warren’s challenge, which he continually reissues, remains unanswered. Many corporate executives resist expensing the value of employee stock options, complaining there is ambiguity in how one values them. But accounting practices are rife with ambiguities. As long as the rules are understood, accounting helps paint a picture of corporate value with a semblance of consistency. For example, corporations depreciate expensive factory equipment according to accounting rules. While depreciation does not precisely capture the exact cost and timing of equipment replacements, it highlights the fact that there is a significant cost to stay in business. The rules of depreciation create some ambiguities; but one cannot use this as an excuse to ignore a real cost of doing business.Treating all employee stock options as an expense clarifies whether the hit to reported earnings is justified by the projected increase in shareholder wealth needed to compensate shareholders for the cost. No wonder some CEOs did not want to expense them. The intent of stock options is benign, but the execution is flawed. In a rational world, options have a realistic strike price reflecting the true business value after building in carrying costs and retained earnings. If employees increase the value of the company beyond that, they can exercise the options, buy the stock at a reduced price to the future higher price due to employee value creation, and participate in the gain. It is theoretically possible to come up with a fair and rational strike price, but it is rarely attempted. Stock options, which are call options, are a moral hazard inviting unnecessary risk taking because corporate officers get leveraged rewards for any success—and suffer no consequences if they fail. Officers of corporations can leverage up corporate balance sheets, make poor acquisitions to pump up revenues, and be rewarded for stock price pumping mischief. Out-of-control—albeit legal—management behavior has no penalty, and often brings rich rewards. When Merrill Lynch parted ways with CEO Stan O’Neal in October of 2007, he received no bonus or severance, but he kept $161.5 million in accumulated compensation and retirement benefits, more than an entire neighborhood of lower middle class Americans will make in a lifetime.Yet, he left Merrill after it took an $8.4 billion writedown in the third quarter of 2007. 3 Shortly thereafter, he took a seat on the board of Alcoa. Derivatives like stock options can be used to leverage a bet.They can also be used to cover a scoundrel’s tracks. The Wall Street Journal exposed a scandal of broad-reaching implications. By August 2006, over 100 corporations—with more to follow—were under investigation for backdating stock options after Assistant Professor Eric Lie of the University of Iowa identified anomalies in the strike prices of employee stock options. The research suggested the prices were intentionally manipulated to give greater value to the recipients. The corporate officers involved are not founders of these corporations; they are merely stewards. These officers consciously betrayed the trust of stockholders, misstated financial reports, and diverted millions of dollars of shareholder wealth for their personal gain. If the corporation marks stock options to market, it may record large fluctuations in value, even if very little money has changed hands. Employee stock options are usually restricted, meaning that employees must wait for a period of time until the options are “vested.” Once vested, if the options have value and are exercised, the company receives a tax deduction. For example, suppose an employee were given options to buy 100,000 shares of the company; the shares vest in three years; and the options have a strike price of $10. In three years, the options will be worth nothing if the share price is below $10, but if the price of the company stock rises to $15, the employee pockets a gain of $500,000, and the company deducts this amount. Most stock options give the employee a window of time in which to exercise the option after it vests, so even if the option cannot be exercised for cash when it first vests, it may become valuable before the window of time is up, also known as the expiration date. Figuring out exactly what the value of the option is today, before the option vests and before the expiration date requires assumptions. One has to estimate the probability of a future gain and the timing of a future gain, and it makes sense to come up with a standard way of estimating today’s value. Every unexpired option is worth something.The options have a positive value today, since they give the employee the right to a potential gain tomorrow. After divorcing his wife of many years and devoted mother to his children, one of my acquaintances crowed that he had “screwed her out of millions.” As part of the divorce settlement, he kept his entire passel of unexercised stock options. He persuaded his wife’s lawyer that these options were virtually worthless and negotiated away other much less valuable assets instead. Shortly afterwards, he monetized the options and figured his after-tax take was around $3 million. Did I mention he is an acquaintance, not a friend? In 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) finally drafted a proposal requiring companies, whose stocks are listed on U.S. exchanges, to show the value of employee stock options as an expense. Neither Warren Buffett nor I anticipated the possibility that corporate executives might manipulate the value of the options awarded them by “backdating.” We were concerned about arguably more benign distortions of reported value. In April 2004, I told the Financial Times it is still possible to manipulate the value of the options and therefore manipulate the amount of the expense. 4 Wh+ichever option pricing model a corporation uses, the biggest fudge factor in determining value is the volatility assumption. Volatility is related to the price of the stock. For a call option, lower volatility means a lower option price, which means a lower corporate expense. One proposal had surfaced suggesting that one could assume zero volatility. Have you ever heard of a stock price that never moved? Then, in July 2004, Warren penned an editorial for the Washington Post. I dubbed it “Warren’s Kill Bill article.” The U.S. House of Representatives proposed a bill that would allow corporations to expense only those stock options awarded to the chief executive and the other four highest-paid officers. Other employee stock options would not be expensed. Obviously, this would have created a huge accounting distortion. Warren advocates expensing all stock options. Warren admonished Congress. “Legislators,” he warned, “should remember that it is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.” 5 In December 2004, the FASB adopted a new standard (SFAS 123R) requiring that employee stock options be valued on the date they were awarded and expensed over the vesting period of the options. Somehow, the FASB still could not bring itself to require mark-to-market accounting. Almost a year later, in November 2005, the Wall Street Journal opined that data patterns suggested some stock options were backdated to set the lowest possible stock price in the relevant time period. The call options were much more valuable than if they had been awarded without this hindsight benefit. Eric Lie, a “mere” assistant professor at the University of Iowa, identified the pattern. Dozens of corporations and billions of dollars of shareholder wealth was involved. 6 7 The problem with financial products that make cheating easy is that cheats tend to flock to them. The deck is already stacked in favor of stock option holders and against other shareholders. But now the truly greedy pulled cards out of their sleeves. It is not necessarily illegal if everything is fully disclosed, but in every instance, it is sleazy. Moreover, if disclosures are misleading, it can be deemed securities fraud. A March 2006 Wall Street Journal article identified about a dozen companies with suspicious patterns that had become the target of an SEC probe. 8 Backdating ensures the most advantageous value possible to employees receiving stock options, no matter how one calculates the value. For example, suppose the rational strike price of a stock option based on business value is $10 at the time a stock option is awarded. But if, three months prior to the options being awarded, the stock had traded at its lowest price for the past year, say at a price of only $3, a backdating executive could set the strike price of the option at only $3 and give himself a much better chance of realizing a future gain.The option is therefore much more valuable. Backdating is deft theft. Shareholder value is diluted more than any reasonable man expects. Unless the cost of the stock option is expensed, shareholders have a very hard time realizing that executives just took a larger piece of the investment pie than the shareholder might otherwise have been willing to cut for them. Expensing stock options deters cheats.When stock options are immediately expensed, the cost becomes transparent. Had corporate America listened to Warren Buffett, expensing would probably have killed backdating before it started. Warren’s wisdom is often at odds with “famous names” and the nonsense taught by economists in graduate business schools. In August 2006, venture capitalist Kip Hagopian published a commentary in California Management Review, the scholarly journal of the University of California-Berkley Haas School of Business. He stated that expensing employee stock options was improper accounting and argued stock prices reflect employee stock options liabilities, implying that shareholders know how to efficiently value these stock options. 9 He got 29 “famous names” to undersign his article. These included Milton Friedman (who would pass away in November) and Harry Markowitz, both former University of Chicago professors and winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics; George P. Schultz and Paul O’Neill, both former U.S. Treasury secretaries; and Arthur Laffer. Holman W. Jenkins Jr., a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, also supported this notion in a separate commentary. 10 Even if it were true that shareholders are well equipped to independently value stock options—and it is not—the proper place to account for costs is in the accounting statement. Shareholders shouldn’t have to make a separate correction for material information that has been omitted from financial statements. The “famous names” should have lobbied for more transparency, or better yet, the abolishment of stock options as a compensation scheme. Instead, these Princes of Darkness advocated opacity. By September 2006, more than 120 U.S. corporations were under investigation by U.S. regulators for backdating employee stock options, followed by many more. By September 2007, companies including Affiliate Computer Services, Apple Inc., Broadcom, United Health, and more had been subjects of the SEC probe, lost senior executives, and reported serious accounting issues related to backdating. In total, 85 U.S. companies made earnings restatements or took charges against earnings due to backdating. Berkshire Hathaway was not one of them. If you asked the executives to sell the companies they manage at the same dip in the market price that they had assigned to the strike of their stock options, they would protest that depressed market prices do not reflect the true business value and it would be a breach of their duty to the shareholders. In fact, one wonders why some of the executives weren’t buying back company stock at some of the price dips. This would have increased shareholder value. Instead, some executives used their lowest stock price to dilute shareholder equity in order to enrich themselves. Backdating executives and their sycophants twisted financial logic with flexibility that rivals the gymnastics of Cirque du Soleil. There should be some sort of reward for executives that used backdating to increase the probability of their realizing upside without taking additional risk.They demonstrated calculating “creativity.” U.S. lawmakers blamed themselves in the ensuing scandal.They cited a tax law passed by Congress in 1993 exempting employee stock options from the $1 million tax deduction limit for senior executives. Executives have an incentive to award themselves stock options, and backdating may have been an unintended consequence of the law. Honest executives use stock options as they were intended, by both setting rational strike prices and securing the tax deduction, thus benefiting stockholders. Backdating, a perverted twist on employee stock options, is a separate problem. Shareholders and U.S. lawmakers alike were ambushed. Backdating directly benefits the option holders; greedy executives would probably have backdated with or without the tax deduction. The late William Proxmire, while serving in the U.S. Senate, created the Golden Fleece Award for congressmen who waste taxpayer money. The Wisconsin Democrat named it after the mythological Golden Fleece swiped by the creatively deceptive Jason. Following Proxmire’s example, I wrote a commentary in October 2006 bestowing the Golden Fleece Award for Optional Integrity on corporate executives who backdated their own stock options and failed to specifically disclose this material information to their board of directors and shareholders. 11 12 I nominated Harry Markowitz, the surviving Nobel Prize winner who supports not expensing stock options, to bestow the award.Warren called the idea a “gem.” 13 Had I not met Warren Buffett, I do not know if I would have ever published such an article pushing against famous names in finance. Meeting him encouraged me to put my own views forward and not to concern myself with what everyone else was doing, however many titles or awards they may have accumulated. Warren wrote a memo the previous week to Berkshire Hathaway managers partly because of the option-backdating scandal that already embroiled more than 100 companies, and partly in reaction to Hewlett-Packard’s headline-making pretexting scandal. Warren sent me a copy of his memo the day after I sent him my commentary. Former Hewlett Packard chairwoman Patricia Dunn stepped down and, along with four others, faced criminal charges after allegedly using pretexting—a nice way of saying investigators pretended to be someone else to dupe phone companies—to obtain the phone records of staff, board members, and journalists. It seems that in trying to track down a boardroom leak, they became bigger rats. 14 At the time Warren wrote this memo to the “All Stars” 15 (his managers), Berkshire Hathaway employed over 200,000 people. It is impossible to totally eliminate bad behavior in a conglomerate that size. Nevertheless, Buffett asked his top managers to increase their efforts especially when there was even a hint of a problem. He especially admonished his managers not to excuse potential problems because other corporations were doing something problematic: The five most dangerous words in business may be “Everybody else is doing it.”. . . [L]et’s start with what is legal, but always go on to what we would feel comfortable about being printed on the front page of our local paper . . . Your attitude . . . expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most important factor in how the culture of your business develops. 16 On October 8, 2006, I sent Warren an e-mail about a segment I had watched the previous evening on television: I found it ironic that Patricia Dunn of HP defended her actions during her 60 Minutes interview by claiming everyone was doing it while you lead your memo by debunking that excuse. I especially liked: And culture, more than rule books, determines how an organization behaves. Warren agreed that I should share the memo with others, and I sent it to several people, including Richard Beales, at the time a reporter at the Financial Times, who was looking for news. The paper posted the entire letter on its Web site. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, wrote me that he agreed with Warren. When people justify their actions with the excuse that everyone else is doing the same thing, it is a red flag. Warren walks his talk. When he took his stance in the 1980s that stock options should be expensed, it was an unpopular viewpoint. The SEC and U.S. politicians pressured to continue the practice. On Christmas Day 1994, the New York Times’ Floyd Norris handed out a “Consumer Deception Award” to Arthur Levitt, then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Levitt praised the Financial Accounting Standards Board for “great courage” when— after succumbing to political pressure —FASB backed down from requiring that executive stock options be expensed. 17 Even though the FASB, politicians, corporate executives and the SEC supported the opposite view,Warren Buffett never wavered. Neither Warren Buffett nor Charlie Munger takes stock options, restricted stock, or huge cash payouts as part of their compensation packages. Berkshire Hathaway is run more like a partnership than a typical U.S. corporation. The annual report includes “An Owner’s Manual” outlining the partnership commitment. Warren Buffett’s and Charlie Munger’s net worth is due to their Berkshire Hathaway stock holdings, and the other board directors are heavy investors in the company, too. Their own gains and losses are in direct proportion to that of other shareholders. Buffett and Munger draw a salary of only around $100,000. Their wealth grows as they create value for others. Successful value investing is not a get-rich-quick scheme, it is a way to get rich and stay rich. Benjamin Graham wrote that a speculator “wants to make his profit in a hurry.” 18 The global capital markets suffered because people with access to other people’s money wanted to get rich in a hurry, and “investing” seemed to be the last thing on their minds. Backdating executives put their own compensation ahead of investors’ interests. But stock option backdaters are not alone in seeking extraordinarily compensation. Investment bankers that ended up subtracting value from the global capital markets earned millions of dollars for a single year of bad work. Many hedge fund managers create much less value than the prairie princes (Buffett and Munger), yet they rack up compensation in the hundreds of millions of dollars.",

        "text": "Chapter 4 The Insatiable Curiosity to Know Nothing Worth Knowing (Oscar Wilde Was Right) I particularly liked the “Dean Man’s Curve” commentary [ Jan and Dean wrote the song, “Dead Man’s Curve,” and I took Warren’s message to be an intentional reference.] —Warren Buffett to Janet Tavakoli, September 27, 2006 W arren Buffett has nothing against hedge funds, provided the price is right for the risk. After our lunch in Omaha,Warren showed me the letter he sent when he made his rejected bid for Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM). Along with Goldman Sachs and AIG, Berkshire Hathaway made a $250 million bailout bid for LTCM and would have provided an additional $3.63 billion of funding. 1 Instead, the Fed engineered a bailout with a consortium of 14 banks and investment banks; only Bear Stearns famously refused to participate. LTCM had once shorted shares of Berkshire Hathaway—a money-losing bet. 2 That is what happens when eggheads crack. My former Merrill Lynch boss, the late Edson Mitchell, was the banker who oversaw Long-Term Capital Management’s initial fundraising. 3 One of my Salomon training classmates, Swiss-born Hans Hufschmid, a partner and co-head of LTCM’s London office, had borrowed $14.6 million to increase his stake in the fund. 4 In 1993, Salomon denied rumors that Hans’s compensation was as high as $28 million. Perhaps it was only $20 million. Hufschmid decamped for LTCM, because he thought it was a better opportunity. 5 John Meriwether was a managing partner (formerly head of Salomon Brother’s arbitrage group) and a University of Chicago MBA. LTCM’s staff included Myron Scholes and Robert Merton, co-winners of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics, pioneers of equity option model pricing. David Mullins, a former Federal Reserve Bank vice-chairman, was also a partner. LTCM opened for business at the end of February 1994. In the late 1990s, LTCM was the largest hedge fund in the world, until it lost around $2 billion on its highly leveraged investments. According to When Genius Failed, Roger Lowenstein’s book on the Long-Term Capital Management failure, if you invested $1 at the end of February 1994 when LTCM opened for business, it would have been worth $4.11 in April 1998 and only 33¢ by the time of the September 1998 bailout. But that was before fees. After fees that dollar would have been worth only $2.85 at its heyday value at the end of April 1998 and it would have been worth only 23¢ at the time of the bailout. 6 Meanwhile, a dollar invested in Berkshire Hathaway at the end of February 1994 would have been worth $4.44 in April 1998, and while much of the market suffered, it still would have been worth $3.95 at the time of the LTCM bailout. Berkshire Hathaway handily beat LTCM’s peak performance, as shown in Table 4.1 . Berkshire Hathaway beat Long-Term Management Capital’s best after-fee performance by a very wide margin, and maintained strong value while LTCM stock plummeted. Table 4.1 Value of a One-Dollar Investment Source: Roger Lowenstein, When Genius Failed (New York: HarperCollins, 2002), Pp. 224,225.,Tavakoli Structured Finance, and Yahoo! Finance. Soon after LTCM’s bailout, John Meriwether started Greenwich-based JWM Partners LLC. Its $1 billion fixed income hedge fund reportedly lost 24 percent in first quarter 2008. 7 Berkshire Hathaway continues to exhibit the characteristics most of us look for in a life partner: maximum upside for its size with minimum volatility. Warren’s mentor, Benjamin Graham, said that speculators should do so with their eyes wide open. When you speculate, you will probably end up losing money. If you want to try it anyway, limit the amount you risk, and separate speculative enterprises from your investment program. Hedge funds, no matter how safe they are made to sound, engage in speculation. Some hedge funds call themselves “arbitrage” funds, or “quant” funds that perform well in either up or down markets. In reality they are merely hedge funds, and they have risk. If a trade is an arbitrage, you can go long (buy) and short (sell) the identical security in the same time frame and lock in a risk-free return after paying trading commissions. A genuine arbitrage is a money pump. It guarantees a positive payoff with no possibility of a negative payoff and with no net investment. If a hedged trade makes money, then after the fact, it may be tempting to call it an “arbitrage.” To make money, however, historical relationships between your long and short position must remain aligned or must work in your favor. It is much better practice to call a hedge by its real name so that everyone understands you are making a bet, even if it is an educated bet. Many hedge funds that drain investors’ money faster than a blood spurting artery drains your body, proudly—and inaccurately—call themselves arbitrage funds. A quantitative hedge fund, or a “quant” fund, uses models to perform statistical analyses of historical data.They leverage up market bets when they think something is out of whack with history. They hope observed “anomalies” will revert back to historical levels. The future will not necessarily resemble the past. They know this, but they seem to be so in love with their own math that they brush away any doubts. Costas Kaplanis, another alumnus of the Liar’s Poker training class, headed arbitrage trading for Salomon Brothers in London and became the head of Global Arbitrage Trading for Citigroup, after it acquired Salomon. Costas complained to me how an “arbitrage” ruined one of his summer trips with his wife, Evi. He was trying to enjoy an al fresco dinner, but he anguished over an interest rate spread trade he had put on. Positions of $1 billion were not unusual if the volatility was “controlled.” The problem with volatility is that it doesn’t care whether or not you think it is controlled, and the trade had moved against him. He couldn’t eat, he couldn’t sleep, and he couldn’t think. If you lose sleep worrying about losing money, it is not an arbitrage. At its Third World Conference of the Bachelier Finance Society in Chicago in 2004, Phelim Boyle, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics, presented work on stochastic volatility models and made an analogy: “Pricing is like falling in love, but a hedge is like getting married.” It sounded catchy and got a laugh. Never one to leave a bad analogy unchallenged, I countered:“A hedge is just a date. If I am going to marry for money, I’ll marry an arbitrage, but I’ll dump a hedge in a heartbeat.” A genuine arbitrage is a very rare occurrence and technology inefficiencies can be a cause. Lee Argush, the managing partner at Concord Equity Group Advisors, ran a fund that took advantage of a rare information arbitrage opportunity in the new-born Russian currency market exchanges. In the early 1990s, the ruble traded at 200 rubles to the dollar in Moscow, but in St. Petersburg, it traded at 250 rubles to the dollar.The Russian phone system was poor. Even a bandwidth sharing arrangement using excess Soviet military communication lines resulted in numerous communication breaks. (Imagine if there was a real need during the Cold War!) Argush installed Sprint and traded the currency arbitrage. Since a true arbitrage is so hard to find, I focus on value investing for my personal portfolio in the Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett tradition. While Warren Buffett continues to look for value opportunities, all over the globe new money gushes into hedge funds and leveraged investments. We do not care if rich people want to speculate knowing they may lose their money. Unfortunately, many public pension funds and other “safe” investors allocate some of their money to hedge funds. In 1990 there were a few hundred hedge funds with less than $50 billion in total assets under management. By the summer of 2008, there were around 8,000 hedge funds (depending on who was counting) with $1.87 trillion in assets under management. 8 Since hedge funds can only be sold to wealthy investors, they are mostly unregulated based on the flimsy theory that rich investors are sophisticated investors. Only accredited investors are allowed to invest in hedge funds, but they are pretty easy to find. Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 defines an accredited investor as anyone with a net worth—including the value of real estate—in excess of $1 million. If your net worth is not that high, but you have income greater than $200,000 for the past two years—make that $300,000 if you are married—and expected the same this year, you qualify as an accredited investor. A mere million dollars makes you a high-net-worth individual, but that may not be enough to get you access to the elite hedge funds. Some require a minimum investment of $5 million. Others court the “carriage trade” (old money) and the “caviar crowd” (new money), seeking out ultra-high-net-worth investors worth more than $30 million. In the estimated $1.87 trillion global hedge fund business, fewer than 10 percent of the funds control more than 85 percent of the money. Banks, savings and loans, and most investment companies qualify as accredited investors. Most trusts with more than $5 million in assets and partnerships also qualify. Many retirement plans, including Employee Benefit Plans, Keogh Plans, and IRAs meet the test. Now there is a happy thought. A pension fund manager can gamble away your retirement money for you, and sometimes they do, especially if their fees are based on “performance.” Money has flooded into hedge funds. High management fees, combined with little regulation of hedge fund managers, is like throwing gasoline on a lit fire. The easiest way for a hedge fund investor to make a small fortune is to start with a large one. If you are an accredited investor and you are bound and determined to ignore caveat emptor, no one will stop you. Besides, it can be thrilling. But the thrill you experience when you detect a glint of mica—fool’s gold—feels as real as if you had actually struck gold. In the world of hedge funds, there is much mica and little gold. Theoretically, a hedge fund allows investors to invest in ways that would be difficult on their own. It can amass the funds to make a run at the equity of an undervalued company and take the inevitable regulatory heat. It can study thousands of technical charts to look for a market anomaly and perhaps find an “arbitrage” opportunity. It can take large loan positions in interesting ventures. Theory rarely works out in practice. When I met Warren in 2005, six of the top 25 highest paid fund managers achieved only single-digit returns, and these are the “successful” hedge fund managers.Yet Edward Lampert of ESL, one of the “sickly six,” earned $425 million in 2005. The top two earners, James Simons of Renaissance Technologies Corp and T. Boone Pickens of BP Capital Management, respectively, earned $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion. Renaissance’s chief fund charges a 5 percent annual management fee, and the managers take 44 percent of the upside, if any exists. In 2007, Jim Simons, Steven Cohen, and Kenneth Griffin each earned over $1 billion. 9 Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger each earn a salary of about $100,000 per year, yet their long-term track record has topped these hedge fund managers. 10 Many hedge fund managers got into the business because of the incredible success of the legendary Paul Tudor Jones. Tudor Investment Corporation’s $5.7 billion Raptor Global Fund, managed by James Pallotta, had 19.2 percent annual returns since 1993, but when it stumbled a little on U.S. equity investments dropping 8.5 percent by the beginning of December 2007, investors pulled out $1 billion. It is unrealistic to expect that any investment, particularly a hedge fund, will always have a positive return relative to the market. Paul Tudor Jones has had a very successful investment run since 1980 with never a down year until 2007. 11 Yet even he does not represent that his funds are safer than the market. Every new hedge fund manager wants to be the next Paul Tudor Jones, George Soros, Jim Rogers, or Ken Griffin. Like Warren, there are true stars who outperform the hedge fund averages, but Warren may sleep better at night. There is nothing wrong with making a big bet, but one cannot be lulled into thinking that investing in hedge funds is safer than the market. The strategies are so variable that some funds pose much more risk than others. The best can give high performance with few stumbles. Investors may find, however, that at best they have paid high fees to invest with a pale imitation of greatness or a clueless rookie. At worst, they may invest with a crook. Hedge funds have the potential not only to have a zero return—no increase in your capital—for a year, they have the potential to completely wipe out your capital. When you are trying to compound returns, it is fatal to multiply your capital by zero. I run a hedge fund. My strategy? It’s a proprietary secret. Domicile? It is located onshore in the United States, but the investments are global. There is no lock-up or waiting period for withdrawing an investment from my fund. At the moment it is not leveraged, but sorry, you are not entitled to even that much information. You won’t find my fund’s returns reported as part of a hedge fund index. Hedge funds do not have to report their returns. You won’t find my fund covered in the financial press, either. What I refer to are not financial products that I market to outside investors. I refer to my personal investment portfolio. Given the low barriers to entry, almost any portfolio of $1 million or more in discretionary investments can call itself a hedge fund. What does a good hedge fund make? It is supposed to make alpha, excess return—adjusted for risk—above and beyond a passive investment in the overall market, or beta. Alpha is supposed to be your reward for accepting extra risk. Hedge fund investors should expect nothing less from a hedge fund than from any other well-managed company. Just like actual hedge fund, I have no obligation to disclose my portfolio’s return, and I don’t. But my returns after all expenses and taxes are enviable by any hedge fund standard, and actual hedge funds have not given me much competition. Very few hedge funds achieve great returns, and if they do, they are not doing it consistently. Part of the reason my personal returns are so healthy is that, unlike actual hedge funds, I do not withdraw fees ranging from 2 percent to 5 percent of the value of my portfolios each year, nor do I liquidate assets to pay myself 20 percent to 44 percent of the upside. My portfolios are tax efficient. I don’t charge myself administrative fees of around 0.5 percent per annum, and I don’t pay for research using “soft dollars” paid to investment banks by marking up trades at the expense of my investment portfolio. I don’t lend myself money from my investment portfolio. I don’t let brokers commingle my funds with theirs to potentially expose me to their credit risk, either. Unfortunately for their investors, traditional hedge funds usually do the opposite of what I do when it comes to fees and efficiency. Finding the right hedge fund is like truffle hunting—and you need a good pig. Investors may find that fund of funds managers are no help in sniffing out truffles; they are often mere fee hogs. A large Chicago-based fund of funds manager recently observed that out of the universe of hedge funds, only about 25 met his standard for investment. He looks for a critical mass of employees, comprehensible strategies, and well-developed back-office operations. But he is having his own infrastructure problems since his staff cannot keep up with the new structured credit products that the hedge funds embraced. This lack of expertise comes at a high price: on top of hedge fund fees, many funds of funds charge a 2.5 percent load, more than 3 percent in annual expenses, and ask for 25 percent of the upside. Instead of compound interest, you get compound fees. I reinvest my fees. If I would not take out fees for my own use, why would I pay them to a manager who has a mediocre track record? Yet many investors allow mediocre managers to suck the life blood out of their portfolios. Do you want to know the fastest way to become rich in hedge funds? Run one. Financial journalists deify hedge fund managers, who boast of elite sports abilities and savant-like mental powers. A money manager may show off his ability to play multiple chess games simultaneously instead of showing off verifiable weighted average returns.This is especially useful when managers do not have a long, reliable, credibly audited track record to boast about. Blackjack card counting is offered as evidence of a hedge fund manager’s genius. I have played blackjack, I have counted cards, and I have won doing it. Unfortunately, playing blackjack will not make you a better money manager. The cards in the deck are known in advance. Even when casinos reduce the edge of a card counter by adding more decks, the cards are still known in advance. Real world finance is not as dependable. Not only does reality add more decks; it removes cards, and adds wild cards (fraudsters). Probability-based models fall apart. Besides, as Warren Buffett knows, the real action is in insurance companies, not casinos. Warren Buffett plays bridge. What does this have to do with his ability to make lucrative investments? Nothing. It may help keep you sharp, but so would a lot of other mental (or even physical) activities. I also play bridge but I have never played with Buffett.Would I become a better investor if I played bridge with him? Not unless he gave me investment tips at the bridge table. One reads about hedge fund squash champions, marathon runners, hang gliders, bikers, and triatheletes. That has nothing to do with whether a money manager will be successful. But I shouldn’t sell sports short. After running a marathon, I had shin splints for three months. It gave me more time to read annual reports, and that is useful when one is managing money. It seems that hedge fund managers spring up out of nowhere. Many have addresses in New York, London, Chicago, Los Angeles, and other locations, but sometimes these managers are using the addresses of virtual offices in office buildings that provide a telephone number from which calls are forwarded to the “manager’s” cell phone. It is very easy to create the illusion of a global corporate presence in the age of the Internet. It is even easy to create the illusion of a network of legitimate people. Last summer I returned a cell phone call from a “hedge fund manager” who said a professor I know from the University of Chicago’s Graduate School of Business was on his advisory board and the professor suggested he call me. The fellow’s story sounded odd, so I declined to meet with him. I called the professor and asked him how well he knew the man. He admitted to being on the man’s advisory board; but he was about to meet him for the very first time. When I asked the professor why he would lend his name to someone that appeared to operate from a cell phone, he said the man dropped other names and said he had raised $10 million. I told the professor: “I raised $50 million. See how easy it is to say that?” It is also easy to drop names and numbers! While the fellow may be legitimate, the professor had no way of knowing that. It is dangerous to lend one’s name to a total stranger. Warren likes to look people in the eye. In June 2005, I was surprised to get an e-mail from Chris Sugrue, then chairman of Plus Funds. He invited me to some hedge fund events organized in concert with the development office at the University of Chicago: The University and alumni in the hedge fund industry are working together to provide additional networking and educational events in the future. We’ve put together several hedge fund events over the past two years. . . . Starting July 1, 2005, future hedge fund events will only be open to those who are $2,500+ annual fund [of the University of Chicago] donors. Sugrue had an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, but did not have an MBA, and somehow had gotten names of Graduate School of Business alumni to solicit. I wrote back to Sugrue asking for an explanation. I said that I found his e-mail solicitation “pretty shameless.” My firm and nine others had already contributed funds to the Finance Roundtable so that students and alumni could attend for free. We gave hedge fund seminars usually discussing the risks; I had given one myself; they were open—and would remain open—to everyone. The alarming part was Sugrue’s Plus Funds’ association with Refco, where Sugrue had once been an executive. Plus Funds’ investor money had been commingled with Refco’s in an unregulated account. When Refco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 17, 2005, Sugrue demanded that the money be moved to segregated accounts, and the money was moved to accounts at Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. Refco creditors naturally wanted the money back. One wonders why the money was not in segregated accounts in the first place. Refco had lent money to Sugrue for various purposes including $50 million, of which $19.4 million went to an entity controlled solely by Sugrue. 12 Court documents state that “Upon information and belief, Sugrue has fled the United States and currently resides in Angola.” 13 Angola is a lousy venue for hedge fund conferences. Greg Newton pointed out in his blog, Naked Shorts, that the bad news is Angola does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. The good news is that “[f]oreign nationals, especially independent entrepreneurs, are subject to arbitrary detention and/or deportation by immigration and police authorities.” 14 Warren’s Omaha isn’t a grand enough address to feed some hedge fund managers’ ravenous egos. How’s Angola for a swanky address? Robert Cialdini, Ph.D., wrote about confidence men in his book, Influence. Grifters know that glitz, honorific titles, and seeming sponsorship of well-known institutions have a powerful influential effect on us, and they do so without any conscious effort on our part. Investment banks tend to lend money just because another investment bank has lent money due to pluralistic ignorance. The second bank to lend will assume the first bank checked out the borrower, and it will skimp on its due diligence. We look around to see what the other guy is doing, and if everyone else is doing it, we go ahead. As Warren Buffett admonished in his letter to his All-Stars, don’t do something just because “everybody else is doing it.” 15 Fortunately, Dr. Cialdini points out that all we have to do avoid being fooled is to make a conscious decision to look for counterfeit social evidence. People can rent virtual offices, expensive homes, flashy cars, and eye-popping jewelry. They can infiltrate the alumni list of a prestigious business school. Question everything. By the way, Robert Cialdini got his Ph.D. in psychology. Did you even question me? But if Cialdini’s Ph.D had been in art history, you would be right to be upset with me for citing him as an expert in psychology. Irrational hype should make an investor skeptical as should any claim of intellectual superiority or mystical abilities. Some men seem driven to self aggrandizement. When Father W. Meissner’s psychobiography of St. Ignatius was published in the 1990s, shock waves reverberated through the Catholic Jesuit community. Ignatius was born to a noble Spanish family and aspired to become the paragon of hidalgos; he was a soldier, courtier, and seducer. After a canon ball shattered his leg, Ignatius devoted his energies to founding the Society of Jesus. Meissner claimed he displayed the symptoms of a phallic narcissist: exhibitionism, self aggrandizement, arrogance, unwillingness to accept defeat, and a need for power and prestige. Phallic narcissists can have “counterphobic competitiveness and a willingness to take risks or court danger in the service of self-display.” This “ruthless drive” may give them the “appearance of strength of character and resourcefulness.” 16 In other words, the biography of the saint read like the profile of many a hedge fund manager. Alfred Borden, a magician played by Christian Bale in The Prestige, counsels a small boy on the art of illusion: “Never show anyone anything. No one is impressed by the secret. It is what you use it for that impresses.” Borden offers this advice right after showing the lad a cheesy coin trick. Just as a private investment portfolio can maintain secrecy, hedge fund strategies can remain a proprietary secret. Hedge funds that have a “patented” investment strategy or that feel they have a “proprietary” model that only they, “the smartest guys in the room,” have discovered, are probably bad bets. The usual excuse for secrecy is that they do not want someone else to copy their trades or manipulate the market and damage their profits. That was Long-Term Capital Management’s excuse, until it blew up and had to disclose its positions to its creditors. Sometimes there is no strategy other than to employ as much leverage as possible with the hope to get lucky. What if the secret strategy means your hedge fund manager invests in a diversified stock index fund portfolio and pays fees of only about 0.1 percent per year while charging you much more? How would you know? Suppose your hedge fund manager thinks the stock market is going to tank. When a hedge fund manager has more than $1 billion in funds under management, he can invest in virtually risk-free T-bills and do well for himself with a 2 percent management fee. In a down market, he can claim victory with even a small positive performance. How long would it take investors to figure it out they are paying hedge fund fees for T-bill performance and pull out? Remember, the strategy must stay secret. Warren does his best to create transparency. His shareholder letters try to explain everything, even anomalies created by accounting and conventional reporting. He even explains his derivatives positions and educates investors on potential volatility of earnings. His investors can find him at the annual meeting, and he and Charlie Munger entertain detailed questions for hours on end. The offshore location of many hedge funds makes it easier to keep investors from second guessing managers. Moreover, managers do not even have to tell you when they change strategies, as long as the documents you signed allow them to do it.There is usually a waiting period for withdrawing your investment from a fund, so in the meantime, you just have to take a manager’s word for how well they are doing. A hedge fund manager usually has an anecdote, an after-the-fact anecdote, about how he made a small fortune on a prescient bet on, say, the renminbi. He will leave out the part about the large euro trade in which he lost a large fortune. The manager is rarely able to tell you about his current trades; he will claim he doesn’t want other managers to know his strategy. Hedge funds do not create new asset classes or new investments, and investing in them does not necessarily make you more diversified. You cannot be more diversified than the market portfolio, and hedge funds trade in the global markets. If you go long and short market assets, as traditional hedge funds used to do, the mix does not become more diversified. The stock market offers a simple way to look at this. Together, passive and active investors own 100 percent of the global stock market. The average return of all passive and active investors together is exactly equal to the average return of the global market. The average return of passive investors, the indexers, is also equal to the average return of the global stock market. This means that active investing is a zero-sum game. Given that passive investors’ return is the average, active investors must also have the same average return as the global market, before fees, before expenses, and before taxes. If some hedge funds wildly outperform the market, as some claim to do, other hedge funds must spectacularly underperform. Fees, expenses, and taxes just make the spectacular underperformance even worse. Tavakoli’s Law states that if some hedge funds soar, some must crash and burn. Hedge funds protest that active investors also include some small individual active investors, and they say they are making money off of those people. But there is no evidence that is true. I do not buy the argument that, on average, individual active investors underperform hedge funds. It is probable that individual active investors outperform hedge funds after one adjusts for creation bias, survivorship bias, fraud, other misleading methods of reporting returns, and high fees. Taken as a whole, active managers in the market will underperform the market average by an amount equal to their cost of trading (their trading commissions plus their total fees). This is true for hedge funds, mutual funds, and an individual investors’ stock portfolio. Unless you can consistently improve your assets by trading, the less one trades and the lower one’s fees and commissions, the better off an active investor will be. Investors are only human, and human beings are not good at assessing probabilities (and therefore risk) without formal training. Even experts sometimes have trouble. Scientific American ’s Martin Gardner authored a section on mathematical games and asserted that in probability theory it is “easy for experts to blunder.” 17 One study suggests that people with injuries to the frontal lobe might be better investors, even though this type of brain damage results in poorer overall decision-making ability. Studies showed individuals would take 50-50 bets in which they could win 1.5 times more than they would lose, but people with sound minds would not take the bet unless they had a 50-50 chance of winning twice as much as they might lose. A few business school professors suggested that the brain-damaged people would make better investors. For example, brain-damaged hedge fund managers might accept a 50-50 chance of winning $3 billion versus losing $2 billion, whereas a hedge fund manager of sound mind might not accept the bet unless he had a 50-50 chance of winning $4 billion versus losing $2 billion. The problem with that reasoning, as hedge fund after hedge fund has discovered, is that the market has uncertain outcomes and the probabilities are unknown in advance. In such circumstances, making riskier bets does not show superior decision-making ability, it just means the fund manager is happy to accept a lower margin of safety. Even the hedge fund manager of “sound mind” can be wiped out on a series of bets that have a 50-50 chance of winning $4 billion versus losing $2 billion. John Maynard Keynes warned: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” 18 Warren Buffett is even more risk averse than the hedge fund manager of “sound mind.”Yet he is the best investor in the last century—perhaps in the history of mankind—disproving the theory of efficient markets, a pet theory of many business school professors. “You can occasionally find markets that are ridiculously inefficient,” Warren points out, or “…you can find them anywhere except at the finance departments of some leading business schools.” 19 In his book Innumeracy, mathematician John Allen Paulos gives many examples showing human beings are not good at assessing probabilities without formal training.We like to explain random events after-the-fact as if we predicted the outcomes. Many hedge funds are successful simply because of lucky bets. If the bets randomly pay off and the fund has a great year, the lucky fund manager takes credit for being a genius.When Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a risk theorist, discusses Buffett’s success, he seems to damn it with faint praise: “I am not saying that Warren Buffett is not skilled; only that a large population of random investors will almost necessarily produce someone with his track records just by luck. ” 20 If Taleb needed an example of success due to random luck, he did not choose well; he could have chosen from any number of hedge funds instead. Taleb fails to mention conditional probabilities (in this context), and it is remiss to describe Warren’s success without bringing that up. Certainty is not possible, and luck is always a part of the equation, but Warren works hard to uncover a margin of safety whenever possible. What is the probability of a successful investment, given that one has a sound methodology for analyzing a business? It is much better than the probability of success without the sound methodology, and the probability of disaster is very low. In contrast, a one-sided leveraged bet presents an altogether different conditional probability.What is the probability of a disaster, given that one has merely leveraged a market bet? If one is lucky one will do well, but if one is unlucky—or simply flat out wrong from not doing one’s homework—the probability of disaster is about 100 percent. I sent Warren a client note in September 2006 in which I made a similar point after the Amaranth hedge fund imploded after losing its shirt on natural gas contracts.The hedge fund leveraged up a bet and the bet (on natural gas spreads) went against them. It was a classic Dead Man’s Curve trade: “The last thing I remember, Doc, the market started to swerve.” 21 Unlike Warren Buffett, Amaranth had no margin of safety. Warren wrote back: “You both think and write well.” 22 Since meeting Warren, I’ve found myself comparing every trade against value investing. A man once asked the late Richard Feynman, a Nobel Prize- winning physicist, how he would design an anti-gravity machine.When Feynman replied he could not, the man pointed out that it would solve the world’s problems. Feynman said it didn’t matter, he didn’t know how to do it. Many investors seem to hope that hedge fund managers have designed a strategy that uses leverage to create profits that will forever defy gravity. Yet Warren Buffett will be the first to admit that even he cannot design the financial equivalent of the anti-gravity machine. Most hedge fund managers happily load up on risk to stay in the game. Hedge fund wisdom is “heads I win, tails you lose, and I still win—just not as big.”There is one other possibility:The coin can stand on edge—the hedge fund manager gets bailed out, and you give back your winnings, but we will get to that later. For now, winning means that a hedge fund’s returns are up, managers collect hefty fees while attracting new money, and investors get a reasonable return on their money. Losing means that hedge fund managers still make hefty fees and investors have a negative return or perhaps even lose all of their money.The hedge fund manager hates to lose, since he will not be able to attract new money and the money, upon which he gorges, will shrink, thus decreasing his payday. Nobel Prize-winner Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, a Stanford psychology professor, studied the financial psychology of judgment and decision making. They found that people feel more strongly about the pain that comes with loss than they do about the pleasure that comes with an equal gain. In fact, most people feel about twice as strongly about the pain of loss according to their study. If you really hate to lose, you may feel even more strongly about it than that. Surprisingly, people will take much more risk to avoid a loss than they will to earn a gain, even when the economic results are the same. If you don’t believe it, try the following game. Imagine that I have given you $100,000, and I have also given you two choices. I will either guarantee you an additional $50,000 or I will allow you to flip a coin. If it’s heads you get another $100,000; if it’s tails you get nothing additional. If you choose to take my guarantee, you are certain to walk away with $150,000. If you choose to flip the coin, you get either $100,000 or $200,000. Which option do you choose? Most people choose to take my guarantee and walk away with the certain $150,000. Now suppose instead I have given you $200,000, and I have given you the following two choices. I will either take away—guarantee you lose—$50,000, or you can flip a coin and try for a different outcome. If the coin comes up heads, you lose $100,000; if it’s tails you lose nothing. Now which option do you choose? Most people will choose to flip the coin to try to avoid the certain loss of $50,000 even if it means they might lose $100,000. In both situations, you wind up with $150,000 if you choose my guarantee. In both cases if you choose the coin flip, you have a 50-50 chance of ending up with either $200,000 or $100,000. Most people choose the sure $150,000 when they stand to gain. It is a very different story when they stand to lose. Most people will choose to flip the coin because they will take more risk to avoid losing money, even if that means they will potentially be worse off than if they just took their loss. The feeling seems to be that they should at least try to avoid the loss.They shouldn’t stand by, do nothing and just let it happen to them. I prefer Warren’s conditional probabilities to any of these choices. The odds of a favorable outcome appear much higher to me. Now imagine you were running a hedge fund earning 2 percent on all of the funds you have under management and earning 20 percent of the upside. Better yet, if you can get away with it, take 5 percent as a fee on the assets under management, and take 44 percent of any potential upside. If your bet loses, your investors will withdraw all of their lovely money and you will get no fees at all. How much will you hate losing now? Enough to risk doubling your investors’ losses? If you were the hedge fund manager, would you hate losing enough to make it appear you were making money when you were not? In New York State Court, the trustee for the Lipper Convertibles Investment Partnership filed suit to get money back from a trust fund of Henry Kravis’s children, Sylvester Stallone, John Cusack, and the former New York City Mayor Ed Koch.They had all invested in the partnership, and each of them withdrew their investment and thought they made money. Other investors in the partnership lost money in an alleged fraud. It seems the trustee wanted all investors, even former investors, to share in the pain, claiming the gains were “unjust enrichment.” 23 The estate manager for the Bayou Group LLC was even more aggressive. Bayou had only about $100 million remaining of more than $300 million in original investments. Now Bayou’s past investors are being told they should have known that fraud had occurred, and they had no right to withdraw their money, even if they had withdrawn the money as much as three years before the fund collapsed.The estate manager is seeking not just their gains but even their original investments, so that presumably the pain will be shared on a pro rata basis. The coin is standing on end. Bayou’s principals, Samuel Israel III and Daniel Marino, pleaded guilty to fraud charges after the fund suddenly closed in 2005. Lawsuits alleged Bayou operated a Ponzi scheme using money from new investors to pay old investors. When Israel received his 20-year prison sentence and was ordered to disgorge $300 million, he said: “I lied to you and I cheated you and I cannot put into words how sorry I am.” 24 So, if he had not been caught, would he have put even the admission of his guilt into words? We may never know, but it seems he really hates to lose. Israel wanted a reduced sentence claiming infirmities, but the judge ruled: “He suffered from these ailments while he did the crime. He can deal with them while he does the time.” 25 I learned that Samuel Israel III has a tattoo on his right hip, was born July 29, 1959, his Social Security number is 438-68-0727. It said so on the Wanted by U.S. Marshals notice issued by the U.S. Department of Justice. 26 In June 2008, after Israel failed to report to serve his 20-year sentence, his abandoned car was found on the Bear Mountain Bridge (despite its name, the bridge is not in the vicinity of Dead Man’s Curve). The car contained what appeared to be a rambling suicide note or the first draft of a new hedge fund document. Scrawled on his car’s hood dust were the words “suicide is painless” from the M A S H theme song, which probably doesn’t sound funny to the investors whose cash was mashed by Israel. 27 Israel’s partner, Dan Marino, had earlier left a suicide note saying that he, Israel, and James Marquez, another partner, had “defrauded” investors. But Marino had not committed suicide, and many believed Israel did not either. Lee Hennessee, head of the Hennessee Group, said: “I believe he’s dead as far as I can throw him.” 28 Greg Newton’s blog titled his review of “Scammy’s” disappearance: “Show Me the Corpse!” 29 Twenty-three days after he faked his suicide, Samuel Israel turned himself in, faced an additional bail-jumping charge, and the $500,000 bail was forfeit. 30 Hedge fund managers seeking fast money sometimes find their exit of the business is quick and final. Kirk Wright, the Harvard-educated 37-year-old founder and CEO of International Management Associates, (IMA) committed suicide by hanging himself in his jail cell, after being found guilty in May 2008 of securities fraud, money laundering, and other charges. Since 2001, he had allegedly inflated balances in investors’ accounts and lied to investors about the performance of the $150 million fund, which collapsed in 2006. He spent lavishly and drained the fund’s cash accounts as it collapsed. When taken into custody, he was using an alias and was arrested poolside at the Hilton in Miami Beach, Florida. 31 If Wright had invested his clients’ money in T-bills and taken $3 million in management fees (2 percent of assets under management) per year, the clients would still have been misled, but they would have been better off since at least they would have their principal plus a little extra. It appears he neither played it safe nor legitimately bet the ranch; he simply bought the farm. In finance, the good do not die young and they do not go on the lam. Like Warren Buffett, the good are usually long-term investors and live to a contented ripe old age. Hedge fund managers may invest their own money in their funds thereby claiming their interests are aligned with their investors.Yet are they really aligned? Many managers and employees of smaller hedge funds are not as wealthy as the investors, but they would very much like to be. After all, they reason, if they are taking the risk of working for a hedge fund, they should get paid for it. How much should hedge fund employees get paid? Senior risk managers at investment banks get paid in the high six figures. A well-known bank hired a second-tier compliance officer for $800,000 per year. Structured credit researchers got paid anywhere from the high six figures to $2 million per year. A mediocre senior investment banker will earn around $2 million per year, and a good one can earn much more. But many beginning hedge fund managers can only aspire to this compensation. Many hedge funds are small, undercapitalized shops that have an “investors only” Web site. If a fund rents offices, purchases computers, phone systems, reporting systems, trading systems, hires staff and retains accountants, it may not break even on the 2 percent annual fee unless it has several hundred million dollars under management. The trouble is, if a manager’s results are not good, investors will run for the exits. The strategy reminds me of a bridge saying I sent Warren about having a 50-50 chance your play will win while expecting it to work out 9 times out of 10. The temptation is to lever up just for the sake of making a lucky bet so that the 20 percent fee on the upside kicks in to keep the fund solvent and keep investors happy. But can you trust that leverage is employed for the right reasons when the fund is feeling a cash crunch? Is it any wonder they want a waiting period to return your money? Overcrowding makes most hedge fund strategies look very unattractive. Many hedge funds are merely shorting (selling) volatility to earn risk premiums, selling options in a low implied volatility environment and selling credit default protection in a skinny credit spread environment, or using investment banks’ financing to make a bet on the market. In other words, underperforming hedge funds often resort to leverage in a gamble to inflate returns. It is as if they are the young boy in D. H. Lawrence’s story “The Rocking-Horse Winner,” who gets visions of the winners of Ascot’s horse races while madly riding his rocking horse. At first he wins enough money to pay off the family debts, but that is not enough, the household goes mad with greed and he must keep riding to produce winners until he dies of exhaustion. “Although they lived in style, they felt always an anxiety in the house. There was never enough money.” After the boy’s initial bet wins, the house seems to say: “There must be more money, there must be more money.” When the boy wins even bigger, the voices become louder and more urgent: “There must be more money! There must be more money!” The boy asks his emotionally bankrupt yet greedy mother about luck and she responds: “I don’t know. Nobody ever knows why one person is lucky and another unlucky.” The boy manically rides the rocking horse “Now! Now take me to where there is luck! Now take me!”The voices in the house rise to a frantic pitch: “There must be more money! Oh-h-h; there must be more money. Oh, now, now-w! Now-w-w—there must be more money!—more than ever! More than ever!” The boy eventually dies of nervous exhaustion and his uncle mourns: “eighty-odd thousand to the good . . . But, poor devil, poor devil, he’s best gone out of a life where he rides his rocking-horse to find a winner.” 32 Warren avoids leverage. While it is true that Berkshire Hathaway’s returns would have been much higher on average, both Buffett and Munger feel that it is their responsibility to shelter shareholders from leverage’s swift and painful downside. Benjamin Graham counseled: “It should be remembered that a decline of 50 percent fully offsets a preceding advance of 100 percent.” 33 Some hedge funds are betting on leverage and luck as if they are rocking horses. Instead of relying on rocking horses, they look to their prime brokers, their investment banking and bank creditors. The hedge funds not only gain access to leveraged financing—there must be more money!—the investment banks also provide trading strategies. Richard Heckinger ran into many hedge fund managers during his multiyear stay as managing director at Deutsche Boerse. He believes that many of them have no financial savvy: I am amazed at how many of them don’t understand the nuts and bolts of what they’re trading. I’ve met . . . several dozen over the last several years who are not too clear even on the concept of an “exchange” . . . most deal with their prime brokers and order up their strategies much like calling Domino’s and ordering a pizza. 34 The barriers to entry into the hedge fund world are low, and there seems to be a philosophy in the global hedge world that “anyone can do it.” It seems all it takes to go from zero to hero is swagger and loudly trumpeted self-reported claims. In the late 1990s, there were only a few hundred hedge funds. By the summer of 2008, the number was estimated at around 8,000 globally, and hedge fund management had become a $1.87 trillion industry. Most of the money is concentrated in large funds. Funds that manage more than $5 billion have 60 percent of the market share; funds that manage $1 billion to $5 billion have another 26.7 percent of the market share. Put another way, less than 3 percent of hedge funds control 60 percent of the money, and somewhere between 6 percent to 9 percent of the funds control around 87 percent of the money.That means more than 90 percent of hedge funds are chasing the remaining 13 percent of market share. 35 Hedge fund managers often claim they can beat the S&P 500, mutual funds, and just about any other investment available to individual investors. Some hedge funds state that their goal is to achieve positive returns in both bull and bear markets. Others claim to speculate with the (usually elusive) goal of highly volatile but ultimately high returns. Quantitative funds or “quant” funds like LTCM claim their models help them outperform the market. Survivorship bias distorts returns reported by hedge fund indexes since the low returns of failed hedge funds drop out of the equation. If anemic returns and total wipeouts disappear forever, then reported returns have a greater chance of creating an illusion of better performance than other investments. Creation bias is an even bigger problem. In military terms, it is the strategy of rapid dominance through shock and awe. Only “successful” funds that show a track record of outperforming the market are sold to investors, while failed attempts to create a successful track record are never reported. The initial outperformance has a halo effect on later years since the long-term record will continue to carry its swelling effect, even if subsequent returns are mediocre. As more money flows in, the funds often cannot replicate outperformance, devolving into under-performers. Multiyear returns are rarely dollar weighted, so returns are overstated, because large slugs of new money are earning lower returns. As the funds grow, it is harder to make excess market returns, since it is harder to find those incrementally attractive new ideas and assets. Size has its disadvantages. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger project they can achieve a tax-efficient average annual return of around 10 percent to 15 percent for the next five years—a very respectable return—but it isn’t likely they will match the tax-efficient 27 percent plus average annual return of the past 30 years. Their strategy and projections are disclosed for anyone to read in annual reports. In first quarter 2008, hedge funds reported their worst performance in nearly two decades according to Hedge Fund Research, Inc. 36 Even those numbers may not represent reality because the lack of reporting controls tempt hedge fund managers to inflate their performance. Some academic studies “suggest hedge funds have been routinely dishonest, or at least economical with the truth.” 37 Investment banks tightened credit terms for hedge funds. By the beginning of August 2008, year-to-date hedge fund performance was down 3.5 percent. Hans Hufschmid, a first-hand witness to LTCM’s financing crisis, observed it was “much worse” than in 1998 when LTCM collapsed, because “hedge funds live on credit and leverage and the ability to finance esoteric positions for a long time.” 38 I would have added that some hedge funds seem to extend their lives because of the ability to set the prices on their own esoteric positions. Academics seem late to wake up to this. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger have publicly criticized (mis)representations of hedge funds for decades. Forbes has published article after article about hedge fund problems. Some hedge funds simply make things up. Even “legitimate” reporting is often materially misleading. In 2004, Forbes said: “Fakery aside, hedge funds have returned less than stocks and bonds.” 39 If you took away various ways of plumping up performance such as creation bias (and a variety of other shenanigans) a Reality Check study showed: “TASS [the largest hedge fund tracking service] net returns drop from 10.7 percent to 6.4 percent annually for the six years through 2002.That compares with a 6.9 percent annual return for the S&P 500 and 7.5 percent for Lehman Brothers’ intermediate bond index.” 40 Yet, poor relative average performance did not deter investors. Money continued to pour into hedge funds. Most hedge funds rely on borrowed money. Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and others lend money through hedge fund umbilical cords called prime brokers.Then they trade with the hedge funds and often supply research and other helpful information. Most of the time, the information sharing is legal. If a hedge fund uses borrowed money to buy securities, it backs the loan with the assets it “bought” plus collateral (margin ). For example, if a prime broker lends $100 million to a hedge fund to buy securities that the prime broker’s investment bank is selling, it may ask a hedge fund to put up $10 million or 10 percent as additional collateral against the $100 million loan (so the assets plus margin are $110 million or 110 percent of the amount the hedge fund owes). That way, if the price of the securities falls a little (not more than 10 percent), the investment bank will have a cushion to make sure it gets back its money. If the price of the securities drops by 5 percent, or $5 million, the investment bank will ask the hedge fund to put up more money (approximately $5 million) to keep the percentage of margin roughly constant. When the investment bank calls for more collateral, it is known as a margin call. One would think that investment banks only accepted cash or a cash equivalent such as a T-bill as margin (collateral). But sometimes they accept something very illiquid (while asking for a bit more of the illiquid stuff). Investment banks try not to think about the possibility that the value of the securities will drop by say, 50 percent, or that the hedge fund will not be able come up with the margin when asked (perhaps because everyone is asking at the same time). That would probably mean the hedge fund is going bust. Prime brokers (affiliates of banks and investment banks) avoid thinking about this horrific scenario by comforting themselves with the thought of the high fees they charge the hedge funds. Investment bank prime brokers will even help spawn hedge funds. Typical of most investment banks, Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM) offered a “turnkey” program, essentially a 50-50 economic split after expenses. BSAM became the general partner. In exchange for that, the hedge fund manager would get office space, back office clearance, accounting, legal support, and marketing support, all of which is a top line expense. If BSAM accepted someone onto the platform they also invested seed capital of up to $25 million. 41 Prime brokers provide hedge funds with a variety of services:They provide financing for leverage; they set up custody accounts for their assets; they act as a settlement agent; and they prepare account statements for customers. Smaller hedge funds often rely on their prime brokers for risk management and trade ideas. These smaller hedge funds also tend to drastically underestimate the cost of doing business. Fortunately for hedge fund managers, the fees fund managers charge can add up faster than the miscellaneous charges on a phone bill. If the hedge fund documents allow loans to management, the lowest returning asset in the hedge fund portfolio may be an invisible low-cost loan to management. The investment bank symbiosis did not stop with hedge funds. Investment banks also provided loans, assistance, and even management staff to structured investment vehicles (SIVs), and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) managers, some of which also manage hedge funds. Undercapitalized managers are easily influenced by an investment bank that set them up in business and trades with them. If an investment bank has a large inventory of overrated and overpriced mortgage loan or leveraged loan-backed securities that it needs to get off of its books, it is very convenient to have symbiotic relationships with structured investment vehicles, collateralized debt obligation managers, and hedge funds. As investment banks needed to get bad loans off of their balance sheets, institutional investors became the prey of both hedge funds and investment banks. As General George S. Patton observed: “A pint of sweat saves a gallon of blood.” Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger would not tolerate the kind of risk that would wipe out a lifetime of hard work, and look for a margin of safety when they make a purchase. Their decades-long track record beats all of the top hedge fund managers. Berkshire Hathaway does not promise to do well in both up and down markets. There are years when the value of the stock decreased or underperformed the S&P; but long-term value investors do not concern themselves with chasing a market return.Warren looks for value and for companies that he is happy to own even if the market closed for five years and he couldn’t trade any of the shares. As a disciple of Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett does not distinguish between value and growth companies, since the concepts are Siamese twins. Why would you buy a fair company at a good price instead of a good company at a fair price? If possible, try to buy a good company at a good (cheap) price, and a good company has good growth potential. Berkshire Hathaway defines value companies as those selling at or below a fair price—book value combined with earnings—that have high earnings growth potential relative to alternatives. The price has to make sense and the fundamental economics have to be good. A company (or hedge fund) could produce steadily rising earnings by investing in T-bills, and passive compounding would cause capital earnings to steadily rise even if the company did nothing to generate additional shareholder value. Yet Warren would not consider this to be a value company. Returns are not kept secret.They are available to the general public on Berkshire Hathaway’s Web site. From 1965 to 2007, the S&P 500 (including dividends) has had a compound annual gain of 10.3 percent and an overall gain of 6,840 percent. For the same period, Berkshire Hathaway has shown adorable alpha; it had a compounded annual gain of 21.1 percent and an overall gain of 400,863 percent. 42 In June 2008, Warren Buffett issued a challenge to hedge funds. He has bet Protégé Partners LLC, a fund of hedge funds, that five hedge funds of its choosing will not produce averaged returns net of fees over the next 10 years above the S&P 500. Buffett and Protégé each staked $320,000 to purchase a $640,000 treasury zero that will be worth $1 million in 10 years when the results are in (around a 4.56 percent annualized return—perhaps a better performance return than the hedge funds), and the $1 million will go the winner’s charity. Warren chose Girls Inc. of Omaha, and I am sure they will be delighted when they receive the money. 43",

        "text": "Chapter 5 MAD Mortgages—The “Great” Against the Powerless The manufactured housing industry’s business model centered on the ability . . . to unload terrible loans on naïve lenders . . . The consequence has been huge numbers of repossessions and pitifully low recoverie[s]. —Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway 2003 Annual Report B erkshire Hathaway’s 2003 annual report arrived in my mailbox in April 2004. Reading it, I learned that Berkshire Hathaway had acquired Clayton Homes, the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketer of manufactured homes. Unlike Oakwood Homes, a Berkshire Hathaway investment that lost money in 2002, Clayton Homes is well managed and practices sound lending through its Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance Inc. affiliate. Clayton Homes is noted for the good character of its management in an industry rife with corrupt practices where buyers who could not afford homes were steered into fee-bloated loans created by lenders who should not have lent to them.Warren had learned about those practices the hard way after purchasing the distressed debt of Oakwood Homes, another manufactured housing company, which went bankrupt in 2002. Warren wrote: “Oakwood participated fully in the insanity.” 1 Oakwood Homes (Oakwood) designed and manufactured modular homes and sold them either directly to home buyers or to independent retailers. Oakwood provided loans to buyers of its homes. On its own, Oakwood did not have money to lend. Oakwood got money through a line of credit from Credit Suisse First Boston (Credit Suisse). The credit line was similar to a credit card except that Oakwood had to put up the home loans as collateral. Credit Suisse earned fees for the loans and further fees when it packaged (securitized) Oakwood’s loans. Credit Suisse (the “old investor”) bought the securitized loans and then sold them to so-called sophisticated private and institutional investors (the “new” investors). Many of Oakwood’s “home buyers” had not actually bought a home; they had assumed a mortgage loan they could not pay back. Sales declined. Loan delinquencies (late payments) and repossessions rose. Oakwood Homes had crushing debt and falling income for at least three years before it filed for bankruptcy in November 2002. Oakwood and Credit Suisse sued each other.These nice kids found each other in a dangerous playground; and they courted each other for years, long after the affection had gone. The court issued an opinion in June 2008.The documents said Oakwood’s aggressive lending practices led to the high number of repossessions and a debt load that Oakwood could not support; Oakwood’s liquidator called the transactions it did with Credit Suisse “value destroying.” 2 The court said that Oakwood’s own alleged wrongful conduct prevented it from recovering any money from Credit Suisse; there was equal fault. Basically, the court shrugged at the liquidator’s claim: lay down with dogs, wake up with fleas. An exception to this would have been if Credit Suisse were a corporate insider (say, if Credit Suisse had an officer on Oakwood’s board—which it did not), but Oakwood’s board and management made its own decisions. Warren Buffett learned that the manufactured housing industry’s consumer financing practices were “atrocious,” and securitization made the situation much worse. Investors in the securitizations supplied money to investment banks who lent to manufacturers and retailers, who then lent money to home “buyers” in the form of mortgage loans or real estate investment contracts. Since the ultimate so-called sophisticated investors, the buyers of the securitized loans, were so far removed from the source of action, they often failed to thoroughly check on what they were buying. Warren learned about the Ponzi-like business models in mortgage lending and securitization market fairly early on. He wrote shareholders (in the annual letter) about his disastrous experience and what he learned from it; then he posted the information on the Berkshire Hathaway Web site for the world to see.The financial industry had not behaved well.The problem was fueled by “buyers who shouldn’t have bought, financed by lenders who shouldn’t have lent.” 3 If Wall Street read Warren’s shareholder letter, it either missed his message or walked away with an idea of how to expand on a bad theme. No matter what hedge fund or investment bank one works for, no matter how lofty the title, no matter how successful the investor, they are all subject to My Theory of Everything in Finance: The value of any financial transaction is based on the timing of cash flows, the frequency of the cash flows, the magnitude of cash flows, and the probability of receipt of those cash flows. In finance, we make up a lot of fancy and difficult to pronounce names and create complicated models to erect a barrier to entry that keeps out lay people. High barriers tend to protect high pay. I’ve written books about some of the esoteric products: credit derivatives, CDOs, and more, but before I look at the latest hot label dreamt up, I look at the cash to find out what is really going on. I also ask a lot of questions. Everything trades off the next most certain financial instrument, usually starting with U.S. treasuries as the risk-free benchmark.The price will fluctuate, going up as interest rates fall and going down as interest rates rise. U.S. Treasuries have the virtue of usually having a known coupon that will be paid on known dates and a known maturity date. If we all agree on how to discount those cash flows, the entire market will come up with the same price. With every other security, I will have an opinion about when and whether I will get my cash back. To form that opinion, I need to know if the company, consumer, hedge fund, investment bank, or other entity is good for the money. Why would any diligent financial professional hand over money without asking tough questions of strangers in the marketplace? If a flaky brother-in-law who you wanted to help asked you for a large loan, you would probably grill him before you forked over thousands of dollars. There would be no point in letting him get in over his head since that wouldn’t be a loan, it would be something else: When will you pay me back? How much interest are you promising to pay? How often and when will those payments occur? Do you have any collateral? Do you have any other debts? What is the probability you will hang onto your job this time, so that you will have the money to pay me when it is due? You would probably come up with even more questions, and this is for someone you know. You know how to find him if he doesn’t pay, and you both have an interest in keeping the relationship going. If it looks as if there will be a problem getting money back from a borrower, walk away. The most important part of My Theory of Everything in Finance is the Buffett Rule: Do not lend money to people who cannot pay you back. During the South American debt crisis in the 1980s, U.S. banks warned it would be disastrous for South American governments if they did not pay back their debts. The banks got it partly right. If you are owed billions of dollars by a third world country, and it cannot pay you back, the third-world country is not in trouble, you are. Investment bankers are astute worldly people, and they keep their fingers on the pulse of the global financial markets. However, they tend to run with the herd. After getting badly burned by making unsecured loans to those who couldn’t pay back the money, loans backed by assets were marketed as being a safe alternative. Loans backed by collateral such as homes and commercial property were viewed as particularly safe because one could seize the property and sell it if the borrower could not pay. After the late 1980s thrift crisis, during which savings and loans that made mortgage loans throughout the United States went bankrupt, the government took a more aggressive role in the U.S. housing market. A network of Federal Home Loan Banks makes low-cost loans to banks and financial institutions so that they can lend money to mortgage borrowers. The Federal Housing Administration, FHA, part of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, insures mortgage loans made by FHA approved lenders. These FHA loans are then sold to GNMA (or Ginnie Mae) a government agency that packages (securitizes) the loans for investors. Ginnie Mae “packages,” known as agency passthroughs (they pass through interest and principal payments to investors), are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, meaning U.S. taxpayers. Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHLMC) were privately chartered United States mortgage giants regulated by HUD. While Fannie and Freddie were private and their securitizations were not guaranteed, the overall sense was that they were (1) too big to fail; and (2) had the implied moral obligation of the U.S. government (that would be you, the taxpayer). Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are now so huge that many believed a default by either of them would cause a crisis of confidence and the global markets would collapse—they are too big to fail. Too big to fail means American taxpayers will pay for a bailout. It turns out this thinking was correct. In September 2008, both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship. A new regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) fired (and replaced) the CEOs, fired the former boards of directors, and took control in a form of nationalization. With so much at stake—meaning U.S. government funds obtained from taxpayer dollars—one would think that HUD, the FHA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 12 Federal Home Loan banks (plus the army of regulators that oversee them) would make sure that the lending is prudent, because if it is not, the U.S. government will have to pay. Sadly, that has not been the case, perhaps because the government feels it is dealing with other people’s money—the money of the U.S. taxpayer. Mortgage lending practices in the United States are tightening up, but there is still a long way to go to get back to prudent lending. As for the new regulator, it is headed by James B. Lockhart, who also oversaw the old regulator (the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight or OFHEO). It seems to me that the new sheriff looks a lot like the old sheriff. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgage loans from mortgage lenders and earn fees for guaranteeing payments on other mortgage loans.To prevent losses, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have requirements for the types of loans they will buy. But, they came under pressure to relax those standards, and their risk increased as a result. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac package up these loans and create securitizations known as conventional passthroughs. Some mortgage lenders cannot keep going if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refuse to buy their mortgage loans. In this way, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are indirect mortgage lenders. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are highly leveraged, and they were extremely vulnerable to failure. If you are highly leveraged, you must keep the quality of the mortgage loans very high, because a small decrease in value is amplified by leverage. But if you have it in the back of your mind that you can have a colossal screw-up and someone will bail you out, it almost guarantees you will make lousy financial decisions. It is a crazy way for any investor to think. It is the antithesis of Benjamin Graham’s philosophy. Warren told me that, as an investor, everyone makes mistakes, but you don’t have to do a lot right as long as you avoid big mistakes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac appeared to be careful back in the day. Loans had to “conform” by meeting lending guidelines so the borrower had a good chance of paying off the loan: the borrower’s income had to be verified and documented; total housing cost including insurance and fees—no more than 28 percent of borrower’s gross income; total debt (including credit cards, auto loans, etc.) less than 36 percent of borrower’s gross income; the borrower’s payment history could not include too many late payments. The borrower’s money for the down payments and closing costs should come from his own savings, not from, say, a “gift” (which may in reality be a loan) from a relative. The borrower should have a steady job for at least two years, and enough extra cash to cover at least two months of all living expenses and other obligations.This is called prudent lending, and it protects both the lender and the borrower. Prudent lending practices protect the United States economy from mischief makers whose actions, intended or otherwise, could upset the entire U.S. housing market. But as prudence gave way to politics born out of greed, HUD stopped being part of the solution and became part of the problem. For more than a decade, prudent lending seemed to assuage the fear of losses; but “creative” investment banking ruined even that supposedly safe scenario. If you set up a countrywide system where you overstate the value of an illiquid asset and then lend to borrowers who will have a hard time paying you back, you create bad loans on a massive scale. Cheap money available for loans pushes the prices of homes well above the price of the underlying land and cost to build plus reasonable profit; the prices keep getting pushed upward based on imaginary value and paid for with loans for which few questions are asked. It is as if you created your own third-world country in a bubble. In contrast, Warren Buffett’s Clayton Homes (through Vanderbilt Mortgage) maintains prudent lending standards—that require a certain down payment, proof of income and employment, a reasonable debt to income ratio—the kind of standards that keep people in their homes and paying their mortgage. Suppose there is an unemployed man with no source of other income other than his representation that he is a successful Internet day trader. Up until now, he has not been very successful at anything. He has a poor credit history, and he wants to buy a home he could not previously afford. Fortunately, he says he has a flair for gambling—I mean—day trading, on the Internet. He does not wish to provide documents verifying his success, because the key to his successful formula is that is must remain confidential. Furthermore, he does not want to make a down payment on a home since his capital is tied up in his successful Internet day trading strategy, which he says is more profitable than the housing bubble—I mean housing investment. Why tie up money in a down payment when he can use that money to gamble—I mean—increase his fortune? Fortunately, a mortgage broker, who is completely objective, since his income depends solely on the fees he generates by making mortgage loans, is willing to overlook the absence of documentation. The Internet day trader can state his income, and that is good enough for the mortgage broker. The mortgage lender helpfully informs the day trader that there have been mortgages made to people who apparently cannot afford them other than the fact that they are willing to state an income which suggests they can make the payments—so climb on board.Warren Buffett would likely have asked whether or not the trader can pay him back. He would undoubtedly ask for documentation . After a few months, the mortgage broker calls the day trader with good news. The appraised value of homes in the day trader’s area has gone up, so the day trader has equity in his home. The mortgage broker asks if the day trader would like to take out a home equity line of credit, which can then be used to make the payments on the mortgage of another home, an investment property.Yes? Great! (In contrast, Warren Buffett avoids investing in any business [in this case the loan from a shaky borrower] that has excessive leverage, that is, no equity left in the home.) The way the loans were made was bad enough, but some of the new risky loan products made it difficult for homeowners to pay back the loan, even if their house increased in value, and if the value of the home stayed the same or declined, the homeowner would have a huge incentive to default. These dodgy loans were so laughable that the risk was an open secret. The market made up pet names with catchy tags for this trash. NINJA loan: no income, no credit, no job, no documentation, no down payment, no problem. Get a loan and get in over your head. Liar loans will let us take your homes.You will choke your credit trying to pay back strangulation loans. Vampire loans will suck your blood dry. In 2002, when Warren Buffett took losses due to Oakwood Homes’ bankruptcy and was coming to grips with the credit derivatives losses in his Gen Re unit, President George W. Bush announced his intention to increase minority homeownership by 5.5 million by 2010. It sounded like a great idea—who isn’t for home ownership? He lacked a sound plan to achieve it, and the regulatory policies of his administration enabled fraud fueled by greed. It sounded great to say in 2004 that homeownership had substantially increased. But by the beginning of 2008, homeownership was back down to 2002 levels, and minorities are most at risk for losing their homes—and their creditworthiness potentially ruined for years. 4 Furthermore, the population is still growing as homeownership declined, so we have lost ground. Wealth transferred to the wealthy from the poor, and what cannot be wrung out of distressed borrowers is ultimately being subsidized by tax dollars as the Fed bails out investment banks, banks, and thrifts. The national tragedy is that the Bush administration apparently neither read Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholder letters nor sought Warren Buffett’s advice. In 2003, while Warren Buffett was acquiring ethically run Clayton Homes after having taken the lesson of Oakwood to heart, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the OCC, subverted the states’ ability to defend the rights of mortgage borrowers against predatory lenders. The OCC examines national bank books and inquires about risk management practices in their capital markets areas. In an unprecedented move, it exercised an obscure power in the 1862 National Bank Act countermanding states’ predatory lending laws over the unanimous objection of all 50 states. 5 Ameriquest was alleged to be among the worst of predatory lending offenders. Forty-nine state regulators and the District of Columbia claimed it ran a boiler-room operation slamming borrowers with loans they could not pay back, hidden fees, and undisclosed escalating interest rates. The U.S. Senate delayed Ameriquest founder, Roland E. Arnall’s, confirmation to the post of U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, but approved it in February 2006, after Ameriquest paid a $325 million settlement. 6 Fair Isaac Corporation developed a scoring system (FICO) as a rough guideline of consumers’ ability to pay debts. Subprime borrowers have low credit scores; typically FICO scores are below 650. Lending problems were not limited to subprime borrowers, however. Risky mortgage products combined with overleveraging created problems for borrowers at all income levels, but subprime borrowers were hit the hardest. Subprime borrowers tend to be less sophisticated and include a higher percentage of minorities. Unscrupulous lenders prey on the relative naiveté of these borrowers. In the United States in the last part of the twentieth century, an illegal practice called redlining denied sound mortgage products to eligible minorities. As we entered the twenty-first century, redlining was replaced with a perverse spin called reverse redlining. This was supposed to help minorities buy homes, but instead Reverse Robin Hoods stole from the poor and gave to the rich. Since many subprime loans do not meet the standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, mortgage lenders borrowed most of the money from a handful of investment banks that packaged the loans and sold them to investors around the world (banks, mutual funds, insurance companies and more). The subprime loan disaster would have been headed off if sophisticated investment banks had stopped supplying money (through packaging and selling the ridiculous loans) to shaky mortgage lenders. CNN’s personal finance editor, Gerri Willis, exposed despicable lending practices. She told The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart that in 2007, “ two million people (in the United States) went into foreclosure,” 7 and in a CNN segment in which she and I both appeared, she asserted “the cards were exactly stacked against [the borrowers].” 8 I told her that some borrowers were “actively misled” and these loans on aggressively appraised homes: “were presented as gifts, but they were Trojan Horses you could ride to your financial ruin.” 9 Many minorities are stuck with an insurmountable mountain of debt and many have declared bankruptcy. The net effect is a huge wealth transfer from minorities to builders, fee-earning mortgage lenders, and bonus seeking investment bankers. Warren Buffett promoted affordable housing and sound lending practices; he runs a well-managed corporation that has increased in value thus benefiting shareholders; he has bequeathed most of his wealth to benefit those less fortunate. Meanwhile, mortgage lenders and the investment banks that enabled them stole from naïve borrowers—and investors (such as municipal governments). Many people did not understand what they signed. Stretching funds to participate in what appears to be a rising housing market is merely speculation. No one is entitled to credit for speculation, and credit was pushed on people with the promise of refinancing before interest payments rose, and low-money-down loans were touted as a way to wealth in an unsustainable market in which housing prices were propped up by temporarily cheap borrowing rates. Sign here, you want to own your dream house and get rich, don’t you? The idea that minority homeownership would increase was used as a justification for a lot of bad lending. Predatory lending practices were cloaked in a mantle of moral self-righteousness, as if steering borrowers into risky mortgage products was a public service instead of an act of malicious mischief by savvy financiers. It is true that some borrowers knowingly overreached, but many were duped by confusing and risky loan products. More pain will come due to mortgage loans originated in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Mortgage brokers offered 40-year or 45-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) in which homeowners built up virtually no equity in their homes in the early years of the mortgages. Approximately 80 percent of 2006 loan originations were ARMs of varying maturities with interest payments that reset sharply upward in two, three, or five years. For example, a 2/28 hybrid ARM has a fixed interest payment amount for the first two years, and then resets to an adjustable rate for the remaining 28 years. For a typical subprime 2/28 ARM, after low “teaser” rates of around 8 percent, many loans will reset to LIBOR plus 600 basis points, which as of summer 2008 would be around 8.46 percent.This borrowing rate, however, may be much higher by the time the actual reset occurs, particularly since the Fed will likely have to raise interest rates to head off inflation to avoid further depression of the dollar. For example, using June 2007’s LIBOR rate, the interest payment would have been 11.32 percent. And here is the conundrum facing the Fed: If it raises rates, more bad loans will default and prolong a recession. But low rates fuel inflation, which leads to rising costs such as for gas and food, and the United States may slump into stagflation. Some mortgage loans are interest-only (IO), meaning that the homeowner does not accumulate equity by paying down principal; the only way the home owner can build equity is if housing prices rise, but as a result of profligate lending, housing prices are falling. Some of these loans were made with very low (or no) down payment, so the homeowner would now lose money if the house were to be sold. Option ARMs allow negative amortization, meaning a homeowner’s principal balance—the amount you’d pay if you pay off your loan right away—can potentially rise. Borrowers may have initial payments so low that the payments do not even cover interest costs. Unpaid interest increases the principal amount, the loan balance, resulting in negative amortization. What if you bought a home with no money down (no down payment), and home prices fall? You are in an “upside-down” mortgage. You owe more than the house is worth, and the amount you owe grows bigger every day. As the song goes, you get “another day older and deeper in debt,” and if you sell the house, all you have left is debt. You never bought a home, you simply signed for a loan that you cannot pay off. You are much worse off than you started. These loans are vampire loans because mortgage lenders who keep these loans in their portfolio find that they look better dead than alive. The principal balance increases; the loan value appears higher; but the reality is that the borrower may be about to default on a payment (or may have already defaulted on one or more payments). Sophisticated investment bankers knew this, but they bought these loans from shaky mortgage lenders, packaged them up, and sold them anyway. As Warren Buffett points out, if you lend money to people who cannot pay you back, it will not end well (and it hasn’t). Homeowners with equity in their homes are encouraged to refinance with “no-cost” loans. In my opinion, this term should be made illegal. There is no such thing as a no-cost loan, albeit this type of loan may make sense for homeowners planning to move in a year or two. Fees are buried deep in the mortgage documents as a yield spread premium. Usually a borrower pays around 2 percent of the loan amount in closing costs. On a $100,000 loan there are about $2,000 in closing costs. With a no-cost loan, the mortgage lender builds fees into the interest rate, and the borrower pays the fees over time. Since the lender sells the loan to an investment bank, the lender makes money because the loan paying a higher interest rate sells for a higher price, so the lender gets his money right away. Lenders are not required to tell a borrower how much this is worth, and most borrowers—even educated, intelligent, otherwise savvy homeowners—do not know where to find the yield spread premium in their loan documents, which seems like pages of boring jargon, much less calculate what it is worth. Warren counsels that you should not invest in something you do not understand, and that would also apply when taking out a loan to “invest” in a home. The borrower may be getting a loan with a higher interest rate than he or she could get through another broker or through a traditional bank. Brokers doing this often raise the rate by 0.5 percent over and above the closing costs and what the borrower would otherwise pay elsewhere. For a $100,000 30-year fixed-rate loan, the extra charges mean additional interest payments of $11,500 above the closing costs already built into the interest rates. Honest brokers will run the math for a homeowner, show the borrower all of the fees, and calculate the breakeven ownership time period where the borrower will be indifferent between paying the closing costs upfront or paying the closing costs over time embedded in the monthly payments. Honest brokers will not fee slam by stuffing an extra 0.5 percent into the yield spread premium above and beyond the closing costs. There is no such thing as a no-cost loan. Some brokers of no-cost mortgages will only pay appraisers at closing (when borrowers sign documents to buy the home).They claim the appraiser will otherwise not work as hard to fairly value the property, but the opposite is more likely. A higher appraisal makes it more likely the deal will close, and the appraiser only gets paid at closing. It creates a conflict of interest for the appraiser.The appraiser has an incentive to come up with a higher number to ensure there is additional value for the seller or for a homeowner refinancing a loan. Mortgage brokers are responsible for about 70 percent of subprime loans. Many brokers make prudent loans, but a lot did not. According to Aaron Krowne’s Internet-based Implode-o-Meter, from late 2006 to June 2008, 262 major U.S. mortgage lenders had gone “kaput.” 10 The number continues to climb.This is an unprecedented failure rate. The Alt-A mortgage market includes borrowers that have higher credit scores, but not high enough to qualify as “prime” borrowers. In both the Alt-A and prime markets, borrowers have purchased multiple dwellings with little or no money down. As housing prices drop, these borrowers find they have to sell property at a loss if the debt burden becomes too much for them. Fraud on borrowers is a problem, but so is fraud on lenders. Borrowers, often in collusion with unscrupulous brokers, supplied phony documentation or engage in identity theft. Lenders have a right to complain about this type of fraud, but their own due diligence standards should certainly be tightened. Investment banks funneled money to mortgage lenders by purchasing the mortgage loans and storing them in special purpose companies known as warehouses. Once there were enough loans, thousands of loans, in the warehouse, they packaged up the loans into residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and sold them to investors. As long as the banks could keep stuffing the loans into securitization packages and selling them, they did not have to keep the risk themselves. If you are ethically challenged and have reason to know you are building airplanes with defective parts, you will sell the airplanes as quickly as possible. That way, when the parts give out, someone else will fall out of the sky. Unfortunately for investment banks (and mortgage lenders that sold them the loans), they got stuck, and their earnings crashed. Mortgage lenders were obliged to take back loans that did not meet certain standards. Some of the loans made in 2006 and 2007 were so bad that they began defaulting before an investment bank could get rid of the risk (by selling packaged loans to investors like mutual funds and others). Shaky mortgage lenders could not buy back the bad loans without borrowing money from another investment bank. When things got bad enough, investment banks stopped lending and the shaky mortgage lenders went bankrupt. Many investment banks were stuck with mortgage lenders’ unpaid loans and with a warehouse full of bad subprime loans. One really can’t say this enough: Warren advises that you shouldn’t lend money to people who cannot pay you back. Investment banks—acting as indirect mortgage lenders, bought up the mortgage loans and supplied money to shaky mortgage lenders.They kept the “party” going. Before the party ended, mortgage lenders siphoned off fees and dividends. When everything unraveled, many mortgage lenders had no value to their shareholders and could not pay back their loans from investment banks (“old investors”), without the money provided by the “new investors,” to whom investment banks sold the packaged dodgy loans. Perhaps your mutual fund. The only thing that kept the money train moving was the fact that money from “new investors” was used to generate the illusion of high returns for “old investors.” That is a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme raises money from “new investors” so “old investors” can be paid a return on their money even though the business model is a failure. When Ponzi schemes unravel, even “old investors” lose some of their money, and the “new investors” lose much more. Only “old investors,” who get out very early, escape unscathed. In late 2006, I saw a prospectus for RMBS that took hundreds of mortgage loans, put them into a portfolio, and sold the risk to investors. The deal seemed targeted for foreign investors and showed a portfolio including first and second lien (piggyback) mortgages. Some were adjustable rate, some not. The portfolio included negative amortizing product and interest-only product.The loans were purchased from various mortgage lenders. More than 60 percent of the loans were purchased from New Century Capital, which in turn acquired them from New Century Mortgage Corporation, a subsidiary of New Century Financial Corporation, which filed a news release in February 2007 11 that it would have to restate its financials and filed for bankruptcy on April 2, 2007, under a cloud of fraud allegations. 12 Investment banks had a responsibility to perform rigorous investigations into the quality of loans coming from mortgage lenders. One would expect investment banks that are obliged to perform due diligence appropriate to the circumstances to yell: Stop the money printing presses! For example, Merrill Lynch (the previously mentioned deal was not a Merrill Lynch deal) was a part owner of California-based Ownit Mortgage Solutions. Mike Blum, Merrill Lynch’s head of global asset-backed finance, sat on the board of Ownit Mortgage Solutions. Revenue was up around 33 percent in the first three quarters of 2006, but Ownit was losing money. In November 2006, JPMorgan Chase told Ownit that its $500 million credit line would disappear on December 13. When Ownit imploded, Blum faxed in his resignation. Ownit made second-lien mortgages, issued 45-year ARMs, and originated no-income-verification loans. In the words of William D. Dallas, its founder and CEO: “The market is paying me to do a no-income-verification loan more than it is paying me to do the full documentation loans.” 13 In this post Sarbanes-Oxley world, one might have expected Merrill’s Mike Blum to insist on a fraud audit of Ownit instead of faxing in his resignation. Warren Buffett points out, “[T]here are worse things than Sarbanes Oxley.” 14 This is one of them. Based on public information like this, the SEC should have taken immediate action and asked Merrill and other investment banks why they did not write down losses on mortgage loans and their securitization businesses. If the SEC was not alarmed by the newspapers, they should have been alarmed by an article that I wrote for risk professionals in first quarter 2007. There I emphatically stated that investment bank risk managers involved in securitizing subprime mortgages should get out and short the product, because the predators’ fall was in full swing. It was career suicide to be in a position of supposedly overseeing risk if one did not have the authority to stop the insanity. If, however, one did have the authority to do something about it, the time for action was past due. The SEC may not care about my views, but it ignored many voices from the business media and from investment professionals. Tom Hudson and Beejal Patel of First Business Morning News ( FBMN ) broadcasting out of Chicago documented the troubles of subprime mortgage lenders. They were ahead of the pack in predicting massive write-downs at investment banks.With a shoestring budget and a half-hour broadcast, they presented the best overall coverage of the role of the Fed, mortgage lending, investment banks, and lax sophisticated investors. In fact, they presented great overall coverage on all aspects of finance. The show airs at 5:00 A.M. Chicago, and many Chicago traders—the largest volume of exchange traded derivatives in the world changes hand in Chicago—get up to watch FBMN ’s financial coverage. In March 2007, Tom Hudson noted that “banks, brokers and auto companies” were writing down exposures to subprime lenders. In Chicago, Corus Bankshares, Inc. took a write-down on its shares of Freemont General, a large subprime lender. New Century was being sued in several states to stop it from giving new loans. Hudson noted that the Fed regulates banks and could have pushed to stop inflating the subprime market by allowing them to offer “teaser rates that weren’t explained to the borrowers.” I agreed, “The Fed seemed complacent about the risk.” I added that U.S. pension funds and mutual funds owned some of these risky products.“I don’t know anyone I hate enough to want to have a negative amortizing ARM (also called a pay option ARM ). It is just a bad product.”Your loan amount increases and then the interest rate shoots up,“it is like the levies breaking.” 15 Yet, investment banks and sophisticated investors did not take huge write-downs on their inventory backed by dodgy loans in first quarter 2007. Dodgy mortgage loans (and securities backed by dodgy mortgage loans) were priced using a mark-to-model. Investment banks with an incentive to use rosy assumptions controlled the models, and the result reminded me of Warren’s comment about the value of derivatives often being a mark-to-myth. The SEC as regulator of the investment banks had the power, but it did nothing to halt securitization activity. Instead, investment banks accelerated securitization activity in the first part of 2007. A typical residential mortgage-backed security, backed by a pool of subprime and other mortgage loans, has several levels of risk known as tranches. The risk of the first few loans to default in the portfolio is borne by the equity investor sometimes called the preference share investor, and so on up the line. In a typical deal, the lowest-rated BB tranche is protected by the equity investor, who absorbs the first 3.25 percent of the losses in the portfolio, if any.This is also known as 3.25 percent subordination. An investment-grade tranche rated BBB is protected by investors taking the first 5.5 percent of the loans to default, if any. In other words, it is protected by the combined losses absorbed by the first loss investor and the BB investor. An investor in the A rated tranche is protected by other investors taking the risk of the first 10 percent of the loans to default, and an investor in the AA rated tranche is protected by other investors taking the first 16 percent to default. The lowest AAA tranche is protected by 24 percent subordination, and the highest AAA rated tranche is protected by 70 percent subordination. Investors might have felt safe with that much “protection” under the AAA rated tranche, but by December 2007, loans that were 60 days or more late in payments or in foreclosure had climbed to 22 percent (according to LoanPerformance) and recovery rates for subprime loans were very low and varied from pennies on the dollar to 50 percent or so for a first mortgage. Second mortgage loans were often worthless. Collateral rapidly vaporized. Deals made up of piggyback (second lien) loans had principal losses eating through tranches rated “AAA.” Investors with deals backed by first lien loans found that losses ate corrosively right through AA tranches, the higher tranches required massive and multilevel downgrades, and that was for deals that did not include a high concentration of loans from mortgage lenders with allegations of fraud. Based on past experience with unsound lending practices like in the manufactured housing market, these problems were foreseeable, and many professionals, including Whitney Tilson (of T2 Partners LLC and the Tilson Funds) and William Ackman (of Pershing Capital) sounded the alarm. After his bad experience with the Oakwood investment, Warren had warned that securitization distanced the supplier of funds (the investment banks) from the lending transaction (mortgage lenders using mortgage brokers) and “the industry’s conduct went from bad to worse.” 16 Human nature has not changed. As for Merrill, it continued its securitization activity in 2007, despite red flags from failing mortgage lenders, including Ownit. For example, in early 2007, it created a package of loans including piggyback loans issued by Ownit. 17 Around 70 percent of the borrowers had not provided full documentation of either their income or assets. Most of the loans were for the full appraised value (no down payment), and home prices were already showing weakness if not outright falling. In the deal documents, Merrill mentioned that Ownit went bankrupt, but did not mention it was Ownit’s largest creditor. Can Merrill say it did an “arms-length” transaction with Ownit when a Merrill officer sat on Ownit’s board? In early 2008, both Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s downgraded the AAA rated tranche (an investment they had rated as “super safe” with almost no possibility of loss) to B (junk status meaning you are likely to lose your shirt ). Moody’s forecast that 60 percent of the original portfolio value could eventually be lost. 18 MAD is the military term for mutually assured destruction, and unsound mortgage lending practices guaranteed that the housing market would be damaged along with the balance sheets of investors that participated by ignoring the risk or by being suckered into unknowingly taking excessive risk. By turning a blind eye to the massive rape of the mortgage loan market, investment bankers assured damage to the U.S. housing market and to their own balance sheet when they were stuck with enormous exposure to their own mischief. Most of the “early post-signing” defaults in loans, originated through the early months of 2007, had been on “stated income loans,” (also known as liar loans ) especially with loan-to-value ratios approaching 100 percent, whether they were subprime or not. This suggested stated income was overstated. Future defaults would kick in as resets on coupons occurred in a soft housing market. Throughout most of 2007, the Federal Reserve seemed to be in denial, using reverse moral suasion by minimizing estimates of potential damage. On August 3, 2007, I told CNBC’s Joe Kernen: “The market is nervous because everyone feels like they are being lied to. Chairman Ben Bernanke seems to have been doing his homework on Wall Street.” Earlier Bernanke reported subprime loss estimates of only $50 to $100 billion. Credit Suisse First Boston had been projecting $50 billion and Citigroup projected $100 billion for subprime losses. I felt every one underestimated ultimate default rates and equally important “they are grossly overestimating recovery rates in subprime. . . .Wall Street really screwed Main Street.” I had projected $270 billion to $340 billion in subprime losses and around $450 billion to $560 billion for all risky mortgage loan products including Alt-A and prime mortgages. 19 My estimates represented only principal losses, and predatory securitization of predatory loans would amplify these losses. The day the segment aired, a client asked,“Are you saying Bernanke is incompetent, or are you saying he’s a lying coward?” “Can’t you think of any other possibilities?” I asked in reply. “What else could there be?” “He may be brave in support of the wrong cause.” My client later reminded me of those words when Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia, told 60 Minutes that torture (such as waterboarding) is not “punishment,” 20 implying that the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment wouldn’t apply to torture. My client joked that investment banks would like to waterboard me to prevent me from talking. My loss projections were higher than anything coming out of the U.S. government or Wall Street. It turns out I was predicting the greatest losses, and I was too optimistic. Housing speculators and overreaching homeowners took risk, seemingly with “eyes wide shut.” Many others were lured with the promise of homeownership. Predatory lenders targeted minorities and lower-income people who were intellectually and financially mugged, then dumped on the side of the road. The motto of predatory lenders is “every minority left behind.” Before meeting Warren, I wrote about industry problems, but only in a general way. Warren’s subtle encouragement helped me find my voice. Now I specifically challenged the Federal Reserve Bank and major investment banks on national television. I told CNBC’s Joe Kernen that I advocated a temporary moratorium on subprime foreclosures, followed by mortgage restructurings.That meant first reappraising to lower values reflecting the devastation caused by predatory lending and then restructuring mortgages to an affordable fixed rate. In some areas, the reappraised values will be drastically lower and the mortgage terms radically different.This protects misled homeowners. Borrowers complicit in fraud, or who willfully overleveraged, should not be given the same protection but could unintentionally benefit. Helping fraudsters is not anyone’s idea of a solution but having a few of them slip through the cracks was preferable to the ruination of entire neighborhoods.The devastation was already well underway and needed to be halted. In some parts of the Midwest every third home is vacant in minority neighborhoods. Housing prices have plummeted. Fixing the problem for innocent homeowners will mean losses must be born by lenders, including subprime mortgage bankers, investment banks that provided financing to the mortgage bankers, and the investors in subprime mortgages and securitizations backed with subprime mortgages. There is no reason for U.S. taxpayers to bail out the sophisticated financiers. It is counterintuitive, but limiting losses by reappraising and rewriting mortgages would result in a higher recovery rate that would be good for everyone and limit overall losses. Servicers collect and record loan payments and credit loan accounts. In the summer of 2007, a major Midwest-based servicer of mortgage loans told me the rating agencies’ subprime recovery rates were much too optimistic.The servicer said modifying a mortgage was highly preferable to recovering zero or negative value after foreclosure fees and depressed asset prices took their toll on recovery of relatively low loan balances. These were geographically diverse U.S. subprime loans, but they were alike in risk characteristics.The servicer’s staff worked frantic 13-hour days to salvage value. The servicer underreported delinquencies, overdue payments, which were usually reported one month behind prime mortgages already. The day a homeowner missed a payment, the servicer got on the phone trying to work out a new deal. The servicer allowed skipped payments and did not report them as delinquencies. The servicer discovered that if homeowners missed two payments, the loan was virtually doomed to default because most homeowners gave up after that. It aggressively “re-aged” mortgages—ignoring missed payments urging borrowers to make even one payment so the loan could appear alive. If this practice was typical, the scope of the subprime problem was underreported.The servicer restructured loans doomed to fail in the future. It sold loans for pennies (3 cents to 6 cents) on the dollar. Some of the loans had negative equity (the homeowner owed more than the home was worth) at the time of delinquency. The servicer avoided foreclosure, because legal costs relative to low loan balances and long delays ate up more money than it recovered. Assets included trailers, mobile homes, and homes in areas with depressed prices. If this sounds odd, consider that in 2008 a plethora of banks started reclassifying loans on their balance sheets (Astoria Financial,Wells Fargo & Co., and others) or began using more optimistic data (Wachovia Corp. and Washington Mutual). If you don’t like the numbers, just change the definition. In July 2008,Wells Fargo stock price jumped 33 percent when its losses were less than expected, but it announced that, as of April 2008, it would wait an additional two months before writing off a loan (180 days instead of 120 days) saying it did not affect its earnings announcement. At the time Wells Fargo’s portfolio of home equity loans was $83.6 billion and it was showing signs of stress. 21 22 JPMorgan Chase’s CEO Jamie Dimon is a master at balancing the short game of earnings announcements with the long game of running a bank. He steered away from most of the mortgage madness, but announced that “jumbo” mortgages (large balance mortgages to good credits) showed increasing losses. Dimon announced that these prime mortgages to the bank’s best customers had losses of 0.95 percent (up from 0.05 percent the prior year), and the losses could triple. For example in California, housing prices had collapsed leading to higher loan losses even for prime (good credit) borrowers. He said JPMorgan may have waded back into the mortgage market early: “We were wrong.We obviously wish we hadn’t done it.” 23 The Federal Reserve kept interest rates low for years seemingly complacent in light of consumer lending problems in the late 1990s and the early part of the twenty-first century. In April 2005, then Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said mortgage lenders efficiently judged the risk. 24 Instead, Greenspan should have raised the alarm about foolish mortgage lending. The Fed compounded its errors when it bailed out Countrywide, the second largest subprime lender in the United States, which is regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Countrywide is also a primary dealer, authorized to trade U.S. government and other select securities with the Federal Reserve System.The Fed should have revoked Countrywide’s primary dealer status and let it fend for itself. Countrywide posted its expanded interest-only programs on its Web site in September 2003 (and appeared to remove it in 2007). Few borrowers are savvy enough for interest-only loans, since mortgage borrowers paid no principal on loans, just interest. Many hoped housing prices would rise so they could refinance or take a profit.The program included NINA (no documentation: no income verification, no asset verification), No Ratio (no income information, so no debt to income ratio is calculated allowing the borrower to assume a greater debt load than would be allowed with a traditional mortgage), and SISA (stated income, stated assets) loans. The FHA guaranteed some Countrywide loans, and presumably they conformed to FHA’s requirements. But FNMA and FHLMC were the chief buyers of Countrywide’s loans, and many of these loans were problematic. On August 5, 2007, I told CBS’s Thalia Assuras that the mortgage lending relationship with investment banks is one of the largest “Ponzi schemes in financial history” and “risky mortgage products were made to people who couldn’t afford them.” 25 I misspoke. I meant to say it is the largest Ponzi scheme in the history of the capital markets. By the end of 2006, Countrywide’s loans showed signs of trouble. The week of August 6, 2007, rumors hit the market that Countrywide was looking for a “white knight,” a deep pocket investor to either take it over or to provide a liquidity injection, but it had no success. On August 7, 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee issued an economic outlook statement saying that inflation, not the mortgage market problems, were the chief concern, and it would not cut the federal funds rate (the borrowing rate) to inject more liquidity into the market. But just two days later, on August 9, the European Central Bank injected around $130 billion into the European banking system, and the Federal Reserve pumped $24 billion into the U.S. banking system through the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Trading Desk. On August 10, 2007,Warren and I spoke on a different topic, and—without naming names—he mentioned that two large companies had come to him hat in hand needing billions.There would be a couple of major blow-ups since they were running out of options. I independently guessed that Countrywide was one of the beggars. One of the ways Countrywide got money was by issuing commercial paper ( asset-backed commercial paper or ABCP) backed by its loans. The week of August 13, 2007, investors shunned Countrywide’s debt. Nervous investors demanded higher interest rates. Countrywide told its creditors (investment banks) it wanted to borrow money (by drawing on its credit card-like credit lines). Countrywide wanted to borrow $11.5 billion from a 40-bank syndicate. Countrywide was in a desperate situation. Market rumors were that the banks refused to lend the money, and asked the Fed for concessions. On August 15, 2007, I wrote Warren that investors were nervous because Canadian money market funds found their investments (not necessarily related to Countrywide) were backed by risky leveraged subprime products. Prices plummeted as investors realized they would lose principal on AAA rated products. 26 The banks got their concessions, and lent to Countrywide. On Thursday, August 16, 2007, the stock market (Dow) fell more than 340 points as Countrywide borrowed $11.5 billion. It seemed to me that on Thursday, one or more of the banks leaked the news ahead of the Fed’s announcement on Friday because, near the end of trading on Thursday, the market rebounded from the 340 point nosedive to finish down only 15 points. On Friday, August 17, 2007, the Fed announced its concessions—a cut of 50 basis points (bps) in the discount rate to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent along with news of relaxed borrowing terms. The Fed agreed to accept investments backed with (Countrywide’s) mortgage loans as long as they had the now-suspect AAA rating. The Fed also extended the “overnight” discount window borrowings to 30 days. On Friday, August 17, 2007, the stock market marched upward. The Fed’s terms mirrored those that nervous investors refused when they stopped buying Countrywide’s debt.The Fed bailed Countrywide out of its liquidity problems by lending to the banks who lent to Countrywide using Countrywide’s collateral to back the loans. This massive liquidity bailout was the first Fed bailout related to the subprime mortgage lending crisis (as far as I know). The Federal Reserve Bank could have exercised its authority to demand Countrywide modify mortgage loans.The Fed was a pushover. Ben Bernanke had dangled raw meat in the face of hungry wolves. More bailouts were coming. Investors felt pressure from all angles. Quant funds reported losses. I told CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla that quant funds put on Dead Man’s Curve trades, and “model masturbation makes quants go blind.”Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger warned this would happen. They talk about value and price; they don’t talk about betas, correlations, and volatilities. Steve Forbes of Forbes magazine opposed any bailouts. He noted the Fed had kept rates low, fueling the problem. He cautioned that we should “resist the temptation to bail these people out,” and specifically referred to the Fed’s bailout of Long-Term Capital. 27 On August 17, 2007, CNBC aired a series of stories that Warren Buffett might be eyeing Countrywide, but they were all incorrect stories. 28 “It is better to be a bad manager of a good business,” Warren always says, “than a good manager of a bad business.” 29 He seeks good managers of good businesses. I told the Journal Inquirer that the Fed should have asked Countrywide for a quid pro quo in exchange for the bailout: “Given Countrywide’s contribution to the problems in the mortgage loan market, and given company head Angelo Mozilo’s denial of that role, the Fed should have pressured Countrywide’s board to replace him.” 30 Warren wrote me that he agreed with my comments. Less than a year after the August 2007 bailout, Daniel Bailey Jr. got a surprise email reply after asking Countrywide to modify the terms of his adjustable rate mortgage. Bailey Jr. wrote he had not understood how the loan worked; he had been told he could refinance after a year; and now he cannot deal with the payments. Mozilo apparently hit “reply” rather than “forward” when emailing. Mozilo wrote it is unbelievable that most of the letters Countrywide receives seem like form letters. “Obviously they are being counseled by some other person or by the Internet. Disgusting.” 31 I can understand the email SNAFU. One Saturday, I sent my nephew, Kenneth, a link to a cheesy but oddly entertaining David Hasselhoff video.Three hours later, Kenneth C. Griffin, CEO of Citadel Investment Group, replied, “Did you hit my address by accident?” I know Ken Griffin is a gentleman. He promised not to embarrass me by revealing my mistake. I now also know we are both fans of KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand), the talking car in Knight Rider. KITT protected Michael Knight, Hasselhoff ’s character, but no one seems to protect borrowers from predatory lenders. I understand how easy it is to miss-send an email. But I cannot understand why Mozilo was still CEO of Countrywide and in a position to send it. Mozilo stayed on as Countrywide’s CEO until the week after its acquisition by Bank of America was approved by Countrywide’s shareholders on June 25, 2008. 32 Warren is a fan of buying large positions in good stocks, and he is also a fan of Mae West, who once said: “Too much of a good thing can be wonderful.” I am pretty sure Mozilo’s delayed retirement is not what either of them had in mind. By the spring of 2008, it was painfully clear that mortgage loan losses would be much higher than the Fed’s earlier highest projections, and my numbers were closer to reality. The overall size of the U.S. residential mortgage loan market is around $11.5 trillion, of which a little more than 11 percent is subprime and more than 10.4 percent is Alt-A (with credit scores in between subprime and the higher prime borrowers). John Paulson of Paulson & Co. compiled data from LoanPerformance and the Mortgage Bankers Association in a public presentation showing that between March 2007 and March 2008, subprime delinquencies had soared to 27.2 percent in the $1.3 trillion subprime market, an increase of around 163 percent, and in the $1.2 trillion Alt-A market, delinquencies soared to 9.1 percent, a year over year change of around 380 percent. Prime mortgage delinquencies were up to 3.2 percent, a 2.1 percent increase from fourth quarter of 2006 to 2007. Given the gravity of the loan problems, investment banks should have been reporting large losses much earlier. For example, on October 8, 2007, I told clients that Merrill’s mal de MER was just beginning. At the time a friend asked me where Merrill stock would be in six months. I responded: “In someone else’s portfolio.” Not mine and not Warren Buffett’s. Jeff Edwards, Merrill’s CFO had made rosy statements in July 2007. Astute shareholders, not to mention the SEC and Merrill’s board, might have wondered why the massive losses reported in third quarter had not shown up much earlier. Stan O’Neal, the CEO, appeared to have a big problem. On October 10, 2007, I reminded David Wighton of the Financial Times that Merrill was one of the lenders to the mortgage-backed securities hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns Asset Management that collapsed in August 2007. Creditors had challenged BSAM’s mark-to-market valuations in April, and that is what got the ball rolling for the downfall of the funds: “Merrill was not so finicky when it came to marking its own books.” 33 Merrill began reporting massive losses, but in my view, they were quarters late. I was amazed O’Neal was still in his CEO chair. On October 24, CNBC’s Joe Kernen, with GE’s former CEO, Jack Welch, covered Merrill’s earnings report. I appeared on a segment with Charlie Gasparino, CNBC’s online editor. I led off: “Way back in first quarter” I had called this and said Merrill’s risk managers should “ get out and short. Short Merrill’s positions.” 34 Gasparino asserted: “When we were reporting this about three weeks ago, ahead of everybody . . . we reported there was going to be a larger third quarter loss.” I countered that O’Neal has a big problem: “They were not hedging properly in first quarter. ” I added: “I laughed in disbelief” when I saw second quarter earnings. “It is an Enronesque kind of problem, it is a business management problem, not a risk management problem.” Gasparino said he wouldn’t go that far and focused on the CFO (Jeff Edwards) and the potential ouster of a risk manager instead of picking up on my assertion about O’Neal. He said the problem with getting rid of Ahmass Fakahany: “Fakahany (the risk manager) and Stan O’Neal are very close.” “I don’t think O’Neal survives this,” I responded.There is no problem getting rid of O’Neal’s friends if he is gone, and O’Neal will have to answer to shareholders and the board about failure to report losses in second quarter. Within a few days, O’Nal resigned. I added that the rest of Wall Street had underestimated how horrific the losses due to low recovery rates would be in subprime. 35 After the collapse of the stock market technology bubble and the outing of Enron’s and Worldcom’s problems, Stan O’Neal wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal saying,“In any system predicated on risk-taking, there are failures, sometimes spectacular failures. But for every failure to be viewed as fraudulent or even criminal bodes ill for our economic system.” 36 I agree with O’Neal’s words on the face of it. It’s great to have an open mind, but don’t leave it so open that your brains fall out. O’Neal might have added that taking foolish risks and then failing to examine risk in one’s own portfolio makes for poor financial management. CEOs can read the newspapers just like anyone else, and the implosion of mortgage lender after mortgage lender was well publicized.Warren Buffett is a voracious analytical reader, and he told me that he considers risk management one of his key responsibilities as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. If O’Neal did not have time to read the papers, he might have asked a few more questions of his managers about Merrill’s involvement with failed mortgage lenders like Ownit. How could Merrill resell or securitize those loans and earn the same profits healthy loans produce? The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a press release on June 19, 2008: “From March 1 to June 18, 2008, Operation Malicious Mortgage resulted in 144 mortgage fraud cases in which 406 defendants were charged.” Cases have been brought across the United States with losses of approximately $1 billion induced by alleged fraud. 37 When Bank of America Corp agreed to buy Countrywide in January 2008, the all-stock transaction was valued at $4 billion. By the time Countrywide’s shareholders approved the sale on June 25, 2008, the shares of Bank of America had slumped and the value was around $2.8 billion. But Bank of America may not have gotten a bargain. Also on that day, Illinois, California, and Washington State Department of Financial Institutions filed lawsuits against Countrywide, and other states soon followed. 38 39 Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan was the first to file, and the Illinois suit named Angelo Mozilo in addition to Countrywide. She noted that Mozilo has assets. She alleged there was a “pattern of deception.” Countywide had the “worst practices” and the “highest volume” of troubled mortgage loans in Illinois, and the “most toxic product (option ARMS), which she said makes up one-third of Countrywide’s portfolio. “Countrywide broke the law. Homeowners did not.” 40 Eric Mozilo, the CEO’s son, blamed the media, protesting, “All we try to do is put people in homes.” 41 He may be correct. That may be all Countrywide did for many borrowers. But if that is all Mozilo was trying to do, he would have served many borrowers better by inviting them to stay overnight at his place. Giving someone a bad mortgage loan only puts someone in a home temporarily, and, left many borrowers worse off than before they ever heard of Countrywide. Countrywide set up IndyMac (Independent National Mortgage) in 1985. The two thrifts split in 1997 and became competitors. In July 2008, IndyMac became the third largest bank to fail in the history of the United States, and in September 2008, $307 billion Washington Mutual (Sold to J.P. Morgan) became the largest to fail. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is drawing on its $53 billion deposit-insurance fund. Thrifts are regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). John Reich, head of the OTS, seemed to think U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer bore some responsibility for IndyMac’s failure because the senator wrote a letter to the OTS with concerns about IndyMac’s solvency. He also made it public, which in my opinion is like yelling “ Fire! ” in a crowded theater. In my mind, it also begged the question as to why Senator Schumer did not seem compelled to speak up earlier about predatory lending and problems at other institutions—say, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Countrywide. Senator Schumer countered that if the OTS had reigned in Indy Mac’s “poor and loose lending practices,” the thrift would not have failed, and that the regulator should “start doing its job.” 42 Instead of acting like a sheriff of Mortgage Lenders, the Office of Thrift Supervision behaved like the sheriff of Nottingham. The Office of Thrift Supervision had reason to intervene long before mortgage lenders started dropping like flies. If they did not read Berkshire Hathaway’s annual reports, they could read a report from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. It noted in 2005 that all loans (subprime, Alt-A, and prime) have a higher default rate when the homeowner has little to lose—a low or zero down payment, for example. The report suggested that subprime loans with no down payment are an especially bad idea: “Serious delinquency (60 and 90 days) is especially sensitive to homeowner equity and origination.” 43 Loosely translated, that meant that thrifts would have a much harder time getting paid back if they offered risky mortgage loans to people with no down payment and low credit scores. So where was the OTS when no (or low) down payment subprime loans combined with other risky features were being made? As of 2008, although subprime loans are only $1.3 trillion (over 11-13 percent depending on how you define subprime) of the $11.5 trillion U.S. residential market, they are the most troubled. In May 2008, Standard & Poor’s announced that subprime loans originated in 2005-2007 looked awful, and loans made in 2007 were the worst of the bunch. Where was the OTS? Delinquencies for 2005 vintage subprime loans were 37.1 percent and had increased 2 percent from the previous month; 37.1 percent of 2006 vintage subprime loans were delinquent, a rise of 4 percent from March; 25.9 percent of subprime loans originated in 2007 were delinquent, a 6 percent jump from March to April 2008. The 2007 loans were “unseasoned” or young but were already at least a couple of months late in payments. 44 45 In the second quarter of 2008, a Mortgage Banking Association survey revealed that 9.2 percent of mortgages for single family to four-family homes were a month or more overdue or in foreclosure. 46 It was the worst result in the 39-year history of the survey. In the month of August 2008, foreclosure filings in the U.S. rose to a record high of more than 303,000 properties as the continued drop in home prices, combined with tighter lending standards, made it harder for homeowners to refinance their mortgages, with and an estimated supply of unsold homes of 11 months. 47 The direct and indirect costs to the U.S. taxpayer will be difficult to assess because of creative accounting that delays the recognition of the true problem. For example, banks and thrifts announced they were delaying their recognition of losses by allowing delinquencies of up to 180 days before taking a writedown on loans, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said that in the past they wrote down loans when they were 90 days past due, but sometime in 2008 they decided to wait two years. 48 On July 16, 2002, Alan Greenspan commented on the corporate shenanigans after the tech-bubble burst saying “infectious greed seemed to grip much of the business community,” and it was a once-in-a-generation frenzy of speculation.” 49 That was after the mini-frenzies of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Long-Term Capital Management, charged-off credit card receivables, manufactured housing loans, and more. Perhaps Alan Greenspan has found a way to accelerate the human lifecycle. Fortunately for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett is the CEO. At year-end 1999, Berkshire Hathaway was Freddie Mac’s largest shareholder; it owned around 8.6 percent. 50 Warren Buffett may prefer to hold onto stocks forever but only if he finds an investment that can go the distance with him. In his 2000 shareholder letter he wrote: “we sold nearly all of our Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares.” 51 Warren later told me that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began emphasizing revenue targets of around 15 percent per year. He did not feel this double digit growth was sustainable just based on operating earnings alone. More than that, value investors are not impressed by revenues alone. Anyone can use leverage to inflate revenues.The quality of the revenues is paramount, since that is what will sustain profitability. Berkshire Hathaway’s Clayton Homes seems to have avoided the contagion. I toured one of the manufactured homes at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in 2006. Potential homeowners are not encouraged to buy a palace. Clayton Homes offers affordable housing at lending terms designed to help ensure the borrower will be able to pay off the loan. It is the chance for people to live a decent life, and there is dignity in being able to live within one’s means while bettering one’s circumstances. Most of Clayton’s earnings come not from its manufactured housing, but from its loan portfolio. Warren reports its results in the finance section of the Berkshire Hathaway annual report. At the end of 2007, Clayton had an “$11 billion loan portfolio, covering 300,000 borrowers.” 52 Berkshire Hathaway provides the financing (instead of, say, an investment bank that would buy the loans, package them up, and resell them). In contrast to the rest of the mortgage loan market, “[d] elinquencies, foreclosures and losses” have stayed constant and the “Clayton portfolio is performing well.” 53 Unfortunately, for many others in the global financial markets, false promises and broken dreams were part of many investment portfolios.The MADness spread across the globe as if it were a hypercontagious flu virus.",

        "text": "Chapter 6 Shell Games (Beware of Geeks Bearing Grifts) I’ve looked at the prospectuses, and they are not easy to read. If you want to understand the deal you’d have to read around 750,000 pages of documents. —Warren Buffett to Janet Tavakoli, January 10, 2008 O n August 5, 2005, two days after Warren and I set up our meeting, Matthew (“Matt”) Goldstein, at the time a senior writer for TheStreet.com , wrote about problems with mortgage-backed CDOs. Eliot Spitzer, then New York Attorney General, had just sent Bear Stearns Co. (Bear Stearns) a subpoena. Hudson United, a small New Jersey bank, had tried to sell mortgage-backed CDOs it bought in 2002 back to Bear Stearns, the underwriter and seller of the CDOs. Hudson discovered its CDO investments were worth only a small fraction of the “market prices” that Bear Stearns had supplied Hudson up until it tried to sell them back. In April 2005, I addressed the International Monetary Fund in Washington about the hidden risks of off-balance-sheet vehicles, securitizations, and the failure of the rating agencies to reflect these risks in their ratings. Sophisticated investors are baffled by the complexity; even multistrategy hedge funds such as Chicago-based Citadel had contacted me about securitizations. I told Goldstein that investors seemed to rely on ratings and rarely ask how the underlying assets are priced or whether they will get full price if they need to sell the investment: “There are huge transparency issues. In some cases, investors have been taken in by hype.” 1 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a separate investigation into Bear Stearns’ CDO activities. Like the New York Attorney General’s office, it wanted to know if Bear Stearns had mispriced mortgage-backed CDOs and harmed investors. Bear Stearns subsequently disclosed in a regulatory filing that the SEC intended to recommend action. Many financial professionals believed Bear Stearns would be charged for alleged improper pricing of CDOs it had sold to both a bank and an institutional investor. 2 Yet, despite increasing attention in the financial press, the New York Attorney General’s office dropped its case. The SEC’s rumored civil enforcement action involving Bear Stearns’ CDO pricing practices fizzled, and the investigation was closed. 3 The Slumbering Esquires Club rolled over and went back to sleep. The SEC’s new head struck me as the Antichrist of investor advocacy. On July 26, 2005, just a few days before Goldstein’s article and my first reply to Warren Buffett, Christopher Cox attended a Congressional coffee klatch—commonly known as his confirmation hearing—for the post of chairman of the SEC. One of Cox’s former clients pleaded guilty and got a 10-year sentence in a case involving defrauded funds. 4 Cox had worked on a separate public offering that was not implicated in the case. Among other things, Cox wrote a letter for his client saying it “would unfairly and unreasonably harm the investors’ rate of return” 5 to appraise pools of mortgages. Cox also wrote that suitability—a standard meant to ensure that naïve investors did not get saddled with risky product—should not apply: “Because all of the trust fund loans are secured and overcollateralized, there is relatively low risk.” 6 Cox wrote his letter in 1985, and unbeknownst to Cox, his client’s fraud involving separate vehicles began in 1982 and continued until 1994. Appraisals may have stopped the fraud earlier. On July 29, 2005, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reminded his readers of Cox’s letter, yet the Senate Committee unanimously confirmed Cox later the same day. It was time to short CDOs, since the value added by the SEC’s Cox seemed likely to shrivel. When I read prospectuses for CDO deals and CDO-squared deals, I felt as if I had opened a box of candies and found only one or two good pieces.The rest were either missing altogether, or had a bite taken out of them with someone else’s teeth marks. These were definitely not See’s Candies, a Berkshire Hathaway company. Some CDO-squared deals were so bad it left me thinking: Where is the candy?! To use an extreme example, if you only use subprime-backed fraud-ridden mortgage loans as collateral for residential mortgage-backed security deals, and the RMBSs lose 60 percent of portfolio value, if you use investment grade tranches but with ratings lower than the top AAA of these RMBSs as collateral for a CDO, all of the collateral of your CDO will vaporize. If you use tranches of this defective CDO in yet another CDO called a CDO-squared, you are starting out with nearly worthless collateral, so the entire CDO-squared is nearly worthless on the day the deal is brought to market. It seems to me that some investment banks knowingly participated in predatory securitizations. One does not need to read hundreds of pages of prospectuses or perform complicated modeling to know that. Warren looks at every investment as if it is a business, and the only “business” these investments have are the loans backing them. If the loans do not do well, the CDOs backed by them soon follow them down the tubes. It will be too obvious if all of the collateral you use is this bad, so you might mix it in with some Alt-A or even some prime collateral in an RMBS. That way, if you use this collateral for a CDO, it won’t look so bad, and it will be devilishly difficult to analyze. For example, if you use BBB rated tranches of RMBS deals backed by a variety of types of loans, you can mix in 30 percent risky subprime loans. It sounds pretty safe, but losses will probably still eat through the BBB rated tranches. Now you take those doomed BBB rated tranches and combine them with A and AA rated tranches to create a CDO. All of the BBB rated tranches will disappear and probably some or all of the single A. If you buy the AAA tranche of this CDO, and it has around 25 percent subordination, your principal may or may not be in jeopardy, but most of the tranches below it are in trouble. Now if you use those lower tranches to make a CDO-squared, most of those tranches will probably lose principal. In some deals, all of the tranches below the senior-most triple A will lose the entire principal amount, and the senior-most triple A will lose substantial principal. Credit derivatives enable a further level of gamesmanship and opacity. The documentation of many CDOs is dense with all sorts of cash flow tricks, and the contracts for the credit derivatives embedded in the CDOs are not included with the prospectuses. The ratings are completely meaningless. In January 2007, I noticed that U.S. institutional investors curtailed their buying of CDOs. But investment banks had created new types of structured investment vehicles called SIV-lites, or structured investment vehicles with less protection (or lite protection). These vehicles invested in the overrated AAA tranches of CDOs backed by subprime debt, and the rating agencies rated the vehicles AAA. These vehicles, in turn, issued faux AAA asset-backed commercial paper. These new entities seemed like corporations, but the only “business” they have is investing in assets and those assets have to provide “earnings.” Benjamin Graham’s disciples look for better quality of earnings and for earnings growth. As the collateral in the structured investment vehicles inevitably took massive downgrades, the vehicles had to liquidate their wasting collateral, and investors lost a significant amount of their principal. Mutual funds, bank portfolios, insurance companies, local government funds, private investment groups, and more lost billions. Canadians heavily invested, and our North American neighbors lost billions. Since these assets carried high ratings, European and Asian investors also took losses. Despite their “efforts,” investment banks were still stuck with tens of billions of unsold CDOs. They reduced exposures by buying bond insurance, buying credit protection from hedge funds, and doing a variety of leveraged sales. Some of that risk boomeranged back onto bank balance sheets. The madness did not stop with mortgage loans. Collateralized debt obligations can be backed by any combination of debt: credit derivatives, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, other collateralized debt obligations, hedge fund loans, credit card loans, auto loans, bonds, leveraged corporate loans, sovereign debt, or any kind of combination of actual or notional debt man can imagine and create. Stephen Partridge-Hicks, co-head of Gordian Knot, probably the best run structured investment vehicles in the world, felt the effects of a nervous market reluctant to invest in the debt of any investment vehicle. Risky overrated AAA commercial paper issued by risky structured investment vehicles caused investors to shun sound investments. He told me he bought zero subprime-backed investments and rejected a lot of other misrated AAA deals.Yet shortly after Lehman’s bankruptcy, Sigma, one of his two funds, collapsed. If I had a large bonus in my sights and mischief on my mind, how would I unload toxic CDO tranches? This is all hypothetical, mind you, but here’s just one of a number of different gimmicks. If you work at an investment bank and you stuff the toxic tranches of only your own CDOs into another CDO, it will be too obvious.You need help from your friends who work for other investment banks, hedge funds, and CDO managers. Since you all have toxic CDOs and still want to earn high fees, you can all play investment banking hawala similar to the complex, but highly effective, money brokering system used in the Middle East. Hawala makes it virtually impossible to trace cross-border money flows. It will be hard for anyone, except the SEC or someone with subpoena power to examine your trade tickets, to figure out what you are doing. Since the SEC seems to have lost its will to exist, you are good to go. There is just one more thing. As Warren told me at lunch, many people seem to have a perverse desire to make things overly complicated. Yet, the fundamentals of finance do not change. Most value investors will not be fooled, and they actually read your documents. If you really think you can confuse unwary investors about the basics by hiding behind a label such as “synthetic CDO-squared,” you are good to go. Mix your toxic junk with your friends’ toxic junk into a CDO-SQUARED. Now you have deniability. After all, why would you buy someone else’s CDOs if they were toxic? Now get the compliant rating agencies to rate a huge chunk of this risky hairball triple A. If you are lucky, you may find an investor to buy it. Failing that, you may find a bond insurer to insure it. Failing that, you may find an investment vehicle or hedge fund willing to do a credit derivative or other leveraged transaction.These diversions should get you through bonus season. After all else fails, your investment banks can beg the Federal Reserve Bank to take overrated AAA paper in exchange for treasuries. There is one small problem with this. If you know or should know that you are not correctly pricing your balance sheet or if you knowingly sell overrated securities, you must disclose that, and you must be specific about it. If you know something is rated super-safe AAA; but it deserves a near-default rating of CCC, you cannot keep silent about it when you sell it. When I pointed out to an investment banker that this is a classic situation for fraud, he told me: “Our internal OGC [Office of General Counsel] disclaims virtually all liability for [our investment bank] and its bankers in small print fully disclosing the risks in the prospectuses.” I knew what he meant, but he sounded like a smart 10-year-old parroting an adult. “I did not attend law school,” I responded, “but I am pretty damn sure that just because you disclosed serious conflicts of interest, it does not protect you if you fail in your duty of care to investors.Your lawyers can’t give you a license to kill.” The moral hazard swamped any risk the rating agencies’ models could capture. One investment banker crowed to me that the rating agencies are eager for fees and the investment bank’s structurers seeking ratings for their CDOs are “shrewd bullies.” One synthetic CDO deal with a notional amount of more than $2 billion went into liquidation, and less than 3 percent of investors’ money was recovered. Even the investor in the top-most “AAA,” the super senior tranche, lost principal. Perhaps everyone involved with this deal, including the CDO manager, was just very unlucky. But do you want to do business with unlucky people? 7 CDO managers are supposed to be selling securities backed by actual assets—not imaginary assets. In November 2006, I told Asset Securitization that CDO managers are unregulated, and only a handful of managers provide good value for the fees charged. Most do not have the expertise or resources to perform CDO management or surveillance. Many cannot build a CDO model. Many managers rely on the bank arranger both for structuring expertise and to take a lead role with the rating agencies to secure the initial ratings. Rating agencies rarely ask for background checks on CDO managers. Chris Ricciardi, CEO of Cohen & Company, read my commentary and wrote me: “I LOVED it.” He had been thinking about how to be “the best CDO manager in the business,” had independently come to the same conclusions, and found my “insight very compelling.” Yet in April 2008, Cohen & Company’s CDO management arm, Strategos Capital Management, led managers with CDOs in default. The total original amount of the CDOs it managed that had events of default (with as yet undetermined recoveries) was $14.2 billion. 8 On December 7, 2007, I wrote Warren that many asset-backed securitization CDO prospectuses are finance comic books. For example, Adams Square Funding I closed December 15, 2006. It was an “asset-backed” deal, a collateralized deal. It was rated by Moody’s and S&P. Yet, before 2008 ended, the CDO unwound, meaning all of the underlying assets were sold in an attempt to pay investors back. Unfortunately, there was not enough cash after selling the loans to go around. According to S&P, investors in Adams Square Funding I got less than 25 percent of par value—more than a 75 percent loss—on average. Investors were wiped out, except for the investor in the seniormost AAA tranche. 9 Since the prospectus shows that the seniormost tranche made up 29 percent of the deal, it appears those investors may have lost some money, too. It is reminiscent of the opening scenes of the movie Cliffhanger, in which a climber’s supports snap one-by-one ending in a spectacular steep fall. That last plastic buckle was AAA rated. Adams Square Funding I is not an isolated example, just a handy one, because it unwound. It is not even close to being the funkiest deal I have seen. Warren’s ability to say “no” when the risk is not priced correctly is a tremendous advantage to any investors. The prospectus for Adams Square Funding I disclosed the conflicts of interest between the investors, Credit Suisse Alternative Capital (CSAC), and other Credit Suisse affiliated entities, including the Leveraged Investment Group (LIG) of Credit Suisse Securities (CSS). 10 I always recommend that investors eliminate this kind of moral hazard by insisting on changes to the deal. Conflicts of interest do not mean that there is anyone doing anything wrong, but when the moral hazard is enormous, things never seem to end well for investors. Rating agency models do not capture these huge risks, yet, the rating agencies never seem to refuse to rate these deals. I have written books and articles on this problem for years; the ratings on deals with this kind of risk are totally meaningless. Yet the rating agencies continue to defend their indefensible methods. Among many classes of bad deals, the problems of CDOs named after constellations were well publicized. Approximately $35 billion of these CDOs had been underwritten by Citigroup, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Calyon, Lehman, and others.They are mostly fallen stars. I told the Wall Street Journal that Norma, a Merrill-underwritten CDO comprised mostly of credit derivatives linked to BBB rated tranches of other securitizations, “is a tangled hairball of risk.” 11 It had come to market in March 2007, and by December 2007, it was worth a fraction of its original value. The rating agencies slashed its ratings to junk. I added “[A]ny savvy investor would have thrown this…in the trash bin.” 12 Constellation deals were not the only class of dicey deals, and it seems that CDOs bought in the last half of 2006 and during 2007 were particularly awful. Investment banks found they had a huge credibility problem with investors. Merrill Lynch was not alone in having credibility problems, but I happened to review all of their 2007 CDOs that I could track. I looked at 30 CDOs and CDO-squared deals with a notional amount of $32 billion that Merrill Lynch underwrote in 2007. As of June 10, 2008, all of the deals I captured were in trouble at the AAA level. One or more of the originally AAA rated tranches had been downgraded to junk (below investment grade) by one or more rating agencies. Merrill Lynch was not alone in having a poor track record, but this sort of unprecedented performance was hard to beat. CDO managers had nothing to be proud of, either, and many saw their streams of fee income dwindle.The securitization market was in a dead calm. 13 I made my concerns public. 14 15 As far as I was concerned, the Hall of Shame looked overcrowded. Losing trust was not the only problem. Financial institutions lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Bloomberg keeps daily tabulations of subprime related losses worldwide. I told Yalman Onaran that although some mark-to-market losses may be reversed as markets recover, most of the losses are permanent impairments caused by surging defaults: “[O]f course we can’t tell how much . . . may actually be good stuff that will pay back at maturity.” 16 By June 18, 2008, Bloomberg estimated that global bank balance sheet losses due to write-downs and charge-offs at $396 billion. That figure may have been tainted with denial. By October 16, 2008, it nudged past $660 billion. Citigroup had written down $55.1 billion, Merrill Lynch $58.1 billion, and UBS $44.2 billion. Wachovia topped the list with losses of $96.7 billion; Washington Mutual’s losses were $45.6 billion. The list was long and sobering. 17 18 Risky loans made to both risky borrowers and prime (high credit score) borrowers were only part of the problem. Predatory securitizations amplified losses. As a result, the entire landscape of global investment banking changed. The damage to the global markets was much worse, however. Losses reported by the banks do not include losses to hedge funds, private equity investors, mutual funds, municipalities, insurance companies, pension funds, and more.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates losses related to the U.S. subprime meltdown and its fallout could reach about $1 trillion. 19 I blurted out to Warren that I was disgusted with the “ douche bags who got [the nation] into this mess”; then I gasped at the realization of what I had just said. For his part, Warren says that the documentation uses arcane language and that it is impossible to read that many prospectuses just to analyze one deal. One had to read “hundreds of thousands of pages.” 20 Warren once noted: “There seems to be some perverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.” 21 The simple solution boils down to the principles that Warren has espoused for decades: Don’t lend money to people who cannot pay you back. If you do not understand something, do not invest.",

        "text": "Chapter 7 Financial Astrology—AAA Falling Stars I can’t recall we’ve ever asked for management changes in companies we’ve invested in. If they did the wrong thing, they should go. —Warren Buffett, Wall Street Journal, May 23, 2008 A t the end of 2007, Berkshire Hathaway owned 48 million shares of Moody’s Corporation, one of the top three rating agencies (the same shares Berkshire owned when I first met Warren Buffett in 2005), representing just over 19 percent of the capital stock.The cost basis of the shares is $499 million. At the end of 2002, the value was just under $1 billion. By the end of 2006, the value was around $3.3 billion, but it dropped to $1.7 billion at the end of 2007. 1 The sharp increase in revenues is due chiefly to revenues generated from rating structured financial products, and the sharp decrease was due to the disillusionment of the market with the integrity of the ratings. The collateralized debt obligation market grew from around $275 billion in 2000, to about $2 trillion in 2007; then the market stalled. By June 11, 2008, Total Securitization reported that CDOs in default exceeded $200 billion. 2 Investors included insurance companies, bank investment portfolios, mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, money mangers, and more. Every sector of society is affected as misrated products cause actual principal losses combined with loss in value due to declining market prices and illiquidity. More than that, liquidity—coming up with needed cash—is now a global problem, since investors are wary of lending money (by investing) against potentially misrated assets. When I met Warren for the first time, I gave him a copy of another book that I had written, Collateralized Debt Obligations & Structured Finance (2003). It is a study of structured financial products in which I criticized holes so big in the rating agencies’ methodology that you can drive a semi through them. In particular, I highlighted serious problems with inflated AAA ratings in securitizations that have inherent structural flaws, problems with supposedly investment grade rated collateral, and conflicts of interest that hold investors’ capital hostage to the self-interest of “managers” and investment banks. Those conflicts of interest often result in substantial principal losses to investors, and the risk is not captured in the ratings. Cash flows held hostage to managers’ conflicts of interest result in investment casualties. Investors should act like the Israeli Defense Force when rescuing hostages taken in an airplane hijacking to Entebbe—move fast, minimize hostage casualties, and never let it happen again. Unfortunately, instead of taking measures to correct these flaws, the rating agencies seemed to brush aside my concerns and ramped up their flawed structured products ratings business. As Warren points out, everyone makes mistakes. I have found that most people will forgive you anything if there was no evil intent.You acknowledge the error and apologize, correct the error, if possible, and make a commitment to change. Forgiveness comes easier if you did not—inadvertently or otherwise—cause them to lose a pile of money, or harm their children by, say, losing a pile of money intended for their benefit.This works as well in finance as it does in daily life. The rating agencies seem not to care about the market’s forgiveness since not only have they not apologized—a necessary, but not a sufficient condition—they seem to feel the market should change. Specifically, the market should change its point of view about what it expects from the rating agencies.Yet it seems that the market has the right to expect rating agencies to follow basic principles of statistics. This tactic has mainly been successful because the rating agencies act as a cartel, leveraging their joint power to have fees magically converge and have ratings so similar that they have each participated in overrating AAA structured products backed by dodgy loans in 2007 that took substantial principal losses. Meanwhile, many market professionals, including me, pointed out in print that the AAA ratings were meaningless. The rating agencies presented a fairly united front in defending their methods (except for Fitch, which also participated in overrated CDOs and later seemed more responsive in downgrading structured products). Furthermore, many investors have charters that require them to only buy products that have been rated by one or more of the top three rating agencies: Moody’s Corporation (Warren’s Berkshire Hathaway is a large minority investor); Standard & Poor’s (S&P), part of McGraw-Hill Cos., Inc.; and Fitch, owned by France-based Fimalac SA. “Ma and Pa” retail investors found that AAA product ended up in their pension funds and mutual funds because their money managers gave too much credence to an AAA rating. Of the three rating agencies, Fitch has the smallest market share, but it has unique style. Fimalac’s chairman, Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere, and Veronique Morali, the chief operating officer, obeyed French disclosure requirements when she was paid a bonus of 8.7 million euros (around $9.94 million at the time) without board or compensation committee approval. According to the Financial Times , when the bonus was discovered in June 2003, the couple lived together, Fimalac’s finances were tight, and Mr. de Lacharriere had pledged 40 percent of his Fimalac shares as collateral to banks. Upon learning the news, a Fimalac director was more than a little concerned: “I said to myself, ‘Oh no, not this.’ . . . In the U.S. or UK, this would be very serious indeed.” 3 “From a legal point of view,” said Ladreit de Lacharriere, “we have been meticulously correct.” 4 In contrast,Warren Buffett suggested to his All-Stars that they should “start with what is legal, but always go on to what we would feel comfortable about being printed on the front page of our local paper.” 5 I have to admit, though, French perfume on the “odor of impropriety” 6 makes for entertaining reading. Most of the market is dominated by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, especially the U.S. market, where these two U.S.-based rating agencies have been entrenched and have most of the historical data. Moody’s awards a rating based on its estimate of expected loss , a single piece of information, and assigns a rating based on the safest (least expected loss) to the riskiest (highest expected loss): Aaa, Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, A1, A2, A3, Baa1, Baa2, Baa3, Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, B3, Caa1, Caa2, Caa3, Ca, C. Anything above Baa3 is considered investment grade, and anything below that is considered speculative grade. Standard & Poor’s awards ratings based on default probabilities and label products AAA, AA+, AA, AA-, and so on. Fitch uses the same labels. As with Moody’s, anything above BBB- is considered investment grade and anything below is considered speculative grade. I’ll use AAA to denote the highest rating, but will specifically name Moody’s (which uses the Aaa notation) when I am making a point specific to them. Since many money managers cannot buy bonds that are not rated investment grade, and since some are required to sell bonds that fall below investment grade, ratings have a huge impact. This is why when Moody’s admitted that impairment rates show no difference in performance between CDO tranches with a junk rating of BB- and an investment grade rating of BBB, it should have been headline financial news. It was not. 7 Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch have an NRSRO designation, meaning they are “Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations.” Yet, when they rate many securitizations, particularly mortgage-loan-backed securitizations, they fail to follow basic statistical principles. Statistics is the mathematical study of the probability and likelihood of events. Known information can be taken into account, and likelihoods and probabilities are inferred by taking a statistical sampling.The designation sounds impressive, but the rating agencies do not live up to it. The rating agencies problems run deep. In late 2003, the Financial Times took rating agencies to task for misrating debt issued by scandal-ridden Parmalat, Enron, and WorldCom. Fitch protested that “credit ratings bring greater transparency.” 8 Standard & Poor’s retorted that “rating agencies are not auditors or investigators and are not empowered or able to unearth fraud.” 9 I responded that investors would be foolish to believe rating agencies provide greater transparency for structured financial products. In fact, the opposite is true. Investors relying on ratings to indicate structured products’ performance are consistently disappointed in a variety of securitizations. S&P downgraded Hollywood Funding’s deals backed by movie receipts from AAA, the highest credit rating possible, to BB, a noninvestment grade rating. Bond insurers raised fraud as a defense against payment, and S&P had thought payment was unconditional. 10 Warren does not rely on the rating agencies since his fundamental analysis of a business’s value is superior to anything the rating agencies are doing. If you understand the value of a business, you do not need to rely on a rating agency. If everyone followed this guideline, the global credit meltdown could have been avoided. In fact, the rating agencies had warning of the need for change through a series of similar mishaps in the past. In 1998, they downgraded around $2 billion in securitizations backed by charged-off credit card receivables managed by Commercial Financial Services. Ratings went from investment grade to junk overnight. Rating agency failures cropped up again in subsequent years with respect to securitizations by Parmalat, manufactured housing loans, metals receivables, furniture receivables, subprime, and more. When rating agencies make mistakes in securitizations backed by debt, the losses tend to be permanent and unfixable. The sole source of income is the portfolio of assets. If you fail to understand the risk of the assets, you have blown the entire job. Unlike Warren, the rating agencies failed to drill down and examine whether the assets could generate the cash to pay back investors. Rating agencies correctly point out that deal sponsors and investment bank underwriters are responsible for due diligence. Although the rating agencies do not perform due diligence for investors, they can demand evidence that proper due diligence has been performed before attempting to apply their respective ratings methodologies. In fact, it is not possible to perform a sound statistical analysis without it. In the mortgage loan securitization market, a statistical sampling of the underlying mortgage loans should verify: integrity of the documentation, the identity of the borrower, the appraisal of the property, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, and so on. Rating agencies should take reasonable steps to understand the character of the risk they are modeling.Yet, they seemingly rated risky deals without demanding evidence of thorough due diligence. When rating agencies use old data for obviously new risks, it is financial astrology. When rating agencies guess at AAA ratings (without the data to back it up), it is financial alchemy.When rating agencies evaluate no-name CDO managers without asking for thorough background checks, it is financial phrenology. In other words, the rating agencies practice junk science .The result is that junk sometimes gets a AAA rating. Since the rating agencies are effectively a cartel, investors do not have an alternative to this flawed system other than to do their own fundamental credit analysis. Like Warren Buffett, they should understand the investment. The rating agencies are swift to point out that they do not perform due diligence on the data they use and take no responsibility for unearthing fraud; they merely provide an opinion. In past legal battles, rating agencies successfully claimed journalist-like privileges, refused to turn over notes of their analyses, and continued to issue opinions. Independent organizations exist, however, that perform rigorous due diligence for a fee. Underwriters can hire them, and rating agencies can demand to see the results.Yet it seems the rating agencies failed to do so for many structured finance transactions.The rating agencies protest they are misunderstood rather than miscalculating when it comes to rating structured products.They claim the market misapplies ratings by expecting ratings to indicate market price and liquidity, but the former are merely symptoms of the real problem. They take data at face value, slap a rating on a dodgy securitization, and pocket a fat fee. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) may have embraced the rating agencies because these institutions are chiefly made up of economists. The Securities and Exchange Commission is loaded with lawyers. I do not expect lawyers to be rigorous in their analysis, but I expect more of the BIS and the Fed. While there is such a thing as “junk economics,” economics itself is not considered a science. Even so, just because lack of rigor permeates economics, economists should not be allowed to let this seep into other fields, particularly when there is a scientific methodology that can be used as a basis. When they adopted the rating agencies labels as benchmarks, the BIS, Fed, and SEC enabled junk science. Although they shouldn’t, many investors rely on the rating and the coupon when buying structured financial products. Whereas Warren views an investment like a business, many investors view their jobs as getting an investment meeting consensus. That is similar to allowing the manic-depressive Mr. Market to tell you the right price. If you do not understand the value, neither Mr. Market’s prices nor (sadly) the rating agencies will help you understand the value of a structured product any better. Many money managers feel buying a AAA investment is prudent; but if they do not understand these complex deals, they can quickly lose a chunk of principal. Problems are not limited to mortgage loan securitizations. Ratings on leveraged synthetic credit products are often misleading, too. For example, when the products first appeared, I pointed out the triple A rating should never have been awarded to constant proportion debt obligations (CPDOs). These products are largely leveraged bets on the credit quality and market spreads of indexes based on U.S. and European investment-grade companies. The high leverage of the products related to market risk puts investors’ principal at risk. Investors essentially take the risk of the first losses on leveraged exposure to the indexes, and that is the exact opposite strategy to Warren’s margin of safety . “Once again,” I told the Financial Times in November 2006, “the rating agencies have proved that when it comes to some structured credit products, a rating is meaningless. All AAAs are not created equal, and this is a prime example.” 11 After rating an early CPDO transaction triple A, Moody’s was criticized by industry professionals, including me. Moody’s then changed its rating methodology, applying a different standard for subsequent transactions. 12 Investors were attracted by the AAA rating and the high coupons. The investment banks selling them were attracted to upfront fees of 1 percent plus annual servicing fees of up to 0.1 percent. I thought the rating agencies may have been turning over staff too quickly and using incompetent rookies—who could be pushed around by aggressive highly paid investment bankers—to rate these deals. In May 2007, the Financial Times put Moody’s actions in the harsh glare of a newly angled spotlight. It said Moody’s original AAA ratings for CPDO were the result of a computer “bug,” and the ratings should have been (according to Moody’s) four notches lower. Fur flew. A friend joked: Don’t they mean forty? Moody’s documents showed that after it corrected the “bug,” it changed its methodology, resulting in the ratings staying AAA until January 2008, when the market fell apart and the original ratings seemed ludicrous.The CPDOs were downgraded several notches. The part about Moody’s changing its methodology was not news to me. I had included that information in a letter to the SEC on proposed regulations in February 2007, and I specifically objected to the AAA rating on this product. I do not even recall who told me about the change. If it was a secret, it was an open secret. All three rating agencies’ models have more patches than Microsoft software. The news is that the AAA rating seemed to be due to something more than a serious disagreement with my opinion. Moody’s internal memo said that the bug’s impact had been reduced after “improvements in the model.” 13 This suggests that there may be a cause and effect—the inconvenient lower ratings may have been masked by the methodology change. Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, said: “Moody’s alleged conduct in this matter raises questions not only about its competence, but more importantly its integrity.” 14 By January 2008, just under a year after my written comments to the SEC, Moody’s analysts wrote that two of the originally AAA rated CPDOs would “unwind at an approximate 90 percent loss to investors.” 15 The CPDOs were projected to have a 90 percent loss from the rating agency that claims its AAA rating is based on expected loss . Standard & Poor’s had also rated CPDOs AAA. In fact, it was the first to do so, and Moody’s followed suit. S&P vigorously defended their ratings methodology, even after it downgraded CPDOs. In the wake of the negative news, it put Moody’s commercial paper on credit watch. S&P later disclosed that it too found an error in its computer models, but said: “This error did not result in a ratings change and was caught and remedied by our ratings process.” 16 Now we all feel better. In February 2007, Bear Stearns research analyst Gyan Sinha wrote a report encouraging investors to take a long position in the ABX.HE.06-2 BBB- index (an index based on the value of BBB- rated residential mortgage-backed securities backed by subprime home equity loans). 17 Simultaneously, I wrote a letter to the SEC recommending it revoke the NRSRO designation for the credit rating agencies with respect to structured financial products, asserting “ ratings are based on smoke and mirrors. ” 18 On February 20, 2007, Gyan Sinha appeared on CNBC with Susan Bies, a Fed governor who had recently tendered her resignation. Bies thought it could take a year or two for housing inventory to be worked out, and housing had further to fall. She was concerned that hidden inventory was high, houses built for investors were vacant, and the numbers did not reflect the problem. She was surprised that subprime mortgages originated in 2006 had gone bad so quickly. It usually took a couple of years for loan delinquencies and defaults to peak, but 2006 vintage loans were delinquent in just a few months. It seemed to her that loans were made that never should have been made. She echoed Warren Buffett’s 2002 complaint about mortgage lenders in the manufactured housing market. Gyan Sinha agreed with Susan Bies’s assertion that subprime delinquencies could reach 20 percent or a bit higher. He too was concerned about the early delinquency trends, but said that based on his research, at 6 to 7 percent cumulative losses, only 1 of the 20 residential mortgage-backed securities in the ABX index would experience a write-down. Furthermore, he stressed that 75 percent of the capital structure of a CDO is AAA rated. 19 It seemed to me Sinha only had part of the story. He did not mention that ersatz AAA rated tranches did not deserve that rating, or that prices of AAA rated tranches in the secondary market were trading at discounts among savvy investors. I projected a 21 percent cumulative loss rate for first-lien mortgage loans , and the ABX included home equity lines of credit and second liens , so losses would hit the loans backing the ABX much harder than that. Based on my projections, the ABX index would plummet. In January 2007, I had lunch with Bethany McLean, coauthor of The Smartest Guys in the Room , a bestselling book about the Enron debacle. She was intrigued about my assertion that AAA and AA rated products were overrated. That meant that bond insurers such as Ambac, MBIA, FGIC that also insured municipal bonds would have substantial losses. It also meant pension funds, bank investment portfolios, mutual funds, and more were buying investments with a high-rated label, but in reality they had the risk of losing substantial principal. I told her: “No one believes the ratings have any value.” 20 Some AAA rated tranches traded around 95 cents on the dollar in the secondary market. Losses were already being absorbed by lower-rated, but still investment-grade, tranches, and first loss investors of conventionally structured deals were wiped out. Her article appeared on March 19, 2007, St. Joseph’s Day, the patron saint of the homeless.The rating agencies denied there was a problem: “All of the rating agencies say they have scrubbed the numbers, and slices of debt that are rated investment grade will mostly stay that way, even if the collateral consists of subprime mortgages.” 21 Investment banks kept up the front. None of them took the massive write-downs I expected in the first quarter of 2007. Instead, they cranked up the CDO machines.They offered toxic product to unwary investors. On March 22, 2007, I wrote Warren that John Calamos Sr., chairman and CEO of Calamos Investments, does not rely on the rating agencies, either: He mortgaged his house to start his fund, and he did not seek outside money. . . . Initially they tried using Moody’s and S&P ratings as benchmarks, and they got smoked a couple of quarters. They set up their own credit models and use those to the exclusion of ratings. The following year, on Tuesday, March 11, 2008, Bloomberg News reported that AAA subprime residential home equity loan backed bonds were not being downgraded despite having delinquencies exceeding 40 percent. As Bear Stearns gasped its last breaths, I appeared on Bloomberg TV that morning to discuss the structured finance ratings folly. The rating agencies were still in denial. Incapable of accurately measuring the present, the rating agencies provided no useful information for predicting future performance.The ABX indexes referenced 80 faux AAA bonds, and according to Bloomberg ’s analysis, none of them merited that rating. According to its interpretation of S&P’s data, Bloomberg asserted that only six of the 80 AAA rated bonds in the ABX index would merit a rating above BBB-, the lowest possible investment grade rating. 22 In other words, 90 percent of the bonds in the AAA index were not even investment grade. Contrary to the assertions of Nassim Taleb and the Talebites, the mortgage meltdown is not a black swan event (an unlikely occurrence—unless one lives in Australia or New Zealand). It is not even Benoit Mandelbrot’s gray swan , a flawed model that does not foresee disaster. 23 Those labels would have described the 1987 portfolio insurance catastrophe affecting around $60 billion in equity assets, when sophisticated mathematical models originated in academia failed to take into account what happens when a large crowd tries to sell at the same time. Portfolio insurance is a form of “dynamic” hedging that mimics a series of put options—as the stock price falls, the program automatically sells a given amount of stock and invests in cash. If the price falls further, the program sells more stock. In the week before the “Black October” crash of 1987, the Dow fell 250 points, and a large backlog of sell orders accumulated. The following Monday, portfolio insurance kicked in, and portfolio stock and index futures were sold. The market fell more.The market dropped around 500 points, the equivalent of around 2,500 points today. This was a classic liquidity crunch, brought on by model-driven selling, followed by the panic of general investors. The price at which managers were able to sell was much lower than the model’s price because they could not get out in time. To add insult to financial injury, the stock market as a whole was up 2 percent per year. If investors had simply held onto their positions during the “crash,” they would have been much better off. Instead, the models sold at lows, and then repurchased as prices rose. Portfolio insurance is a form of dynamic hedging, which I call death by one thousand cuts. Benjamin Graham was not a fan of market formulas or program trading: “Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell one immediately after a substantial drop.” 24 At least not for the sake of it. As more people rely on formulas, they become less reliable. For one thing, conditions change . Secondly, when a formula becomes very popular, it may cause the stock market herd to “stampede.” 25 At the time, Warren also derided the models. If the price falls far enough, the model sells everything and the manager is 100 percent in cash; when prices rise , the model tells you to buy . Warren loves to buy more when the price of a good value stock falls and seeks to sell, if ever, at a profit. Instead, the mortgage meltdown was caused by Black Barts . Black Bart is said to have robbed California stagecoaches without ever firing a shot, and the mortgage meltdown involved some bloodless robbery. The risk was fully knowable, fully discoverable in the course of competent work. The mortgage meltdown had a direct cause and effect, and the result was predictable in advance. At the outset, symptoms of financial disease were as obvious as an advanced outbreak of mad cow. If one examined the loans they looked like downer cows, stumbling and sickly. Financial professionals including Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, John Paulson, James “Jim” B. Rogers, William “Bill” Ackman, William “Bill” Gross, Whitney Tilson, Jim Melcher, David Einhorn (head of Greenlight Capital), myself, and others had been specific in sounding the alarm both verbally and in print for many years. Money market funds and pension funds often rely on ratings.The SEC is proposing that mutual funds should not rely on ratings, but the SEC is missing a piece.The SEC should not allow an investment below a previously required rating. For example, if an investor relied on an AAA rating before and it did not work out, that should not mean the investor should ignore the requirement and invest in something with a lower rating, either. Rather, the investor should still be required to have an AAA rating and should be required to understand that the value of the investment lives up to the rating. There is often a difference between an investor with a lot of money to manage and a sophisticated investor. For example, municipal funds usually lack the sophistication of Goldman Sachs Asset management. That is why many compliance departments at investment banks ask that brokers and institutional salespeople “know the customer.” The idea is to sell complex products to investors that have the ability to understand and analyze the risk. Or better yet, do as Warren does. Don’t make your investments unnecessarily complex and thoroughly understand the risk. That way, if you make a mistake, it is very unlikely it will be a big one. In spite of this wisdom, funds in Europe and the United States—including local government-run funds—often find they do not understand the risks of complex structured financial products they own, because they rely on AAA ratings for guidance. These Main Street government investors have no choice but to cut costs, aggressively go after back taxes, and—if the problem is bad enough— raise taxes. Main Street’s list of investors that feel burned is long and growing. For example, the Springfield (Massachusetts) Finance Control Board alleged that Merrill Lynch & Co. sold it AAA rated CDO products backed by subprime debt without fully disclosing the risk. State law limits Springfield’s investments to government securities and short-term liquid investments. Regarding Springfield, I told the Wall Street Journal: “Merrill has to know its customers and sell them what’s suitable and appropriate.These CDOs are not.” 26 Springfield was fortunate that its troubles received publicity. It seemed to own the chlorine trifluoride of CDOs. The AAA rated tranches were unstable and lethally toxic to portfolio value. The three CDOs Springfield originally purchased for $13.9 million in the summer of 2007 were valued by Merrill at around $1.2 million by January 2008. Merrill repurchased the CDOs for the full amount of $13.9 million. Vickie Tillman, executive vice-president at Standard & Poor’s defends its AAA ratings: “of the 26,000 structured securities originally rated AAA by S&P between 1978 and 2007, fewer than 0.1 per cent [sic] subsequently defaulted.” 27 That may be true. It may even be true that AAA ratings on securities that were imploding did not have ratings withdrawn to remove them from the data set. But that is not the point. When it counted, when the U.S. housing markets and municipal bond markets depended on the integrity of the ratings, the rating agencies failed. There were a lot of teeth marks in those “boxes” of CDOs backed by mortgage loans. Smart investors avoided CDOs and ate some See’s Candies. In August 2008, a draft version of an SEC 38-page report on the rating agencies revealed that an S&P analyst emailed a colleague that they should not be rating a particular structured finance deal. The colleague responded that they rate every deal: “it could be structured by cows and we would rate it.” 28 Deal after CDO-squared deal brought to market in 2007 had AAA rated tranches downgraded below investment grade within months after the deals came to market. This is unprecedented. Deals brought in 2006 are similarly troubled as are deals brought in the last half of 2005. Dollar values involved are in the hundreds of billions. It is a travesty. Investors in AAA structured finance products are losing substantial principal. Some nominally, AAA bond insurers were downgraded from AAA to junk. The AAA ratings of others Slid lower. Municipal bond markets and student loan markets are in confusion. Investment banks sold auction-rate securities with long maturities as if they were money market instruments.They told customers that the coupons reset at regular auctions at short-term intervals, and if the auctions failed to find buyers, the investment banks would step in and buy back the securities. Investors could not get their money. Investors from large corporations to condominium boards investing members’ assessments held frozen assets. Yet they had been told the bonds are exactly like cash. By the fall of 2008, banks and investment banks were compelled to buy back auction rate securities from retail investors to settle claims with U.S. regulators that they improperly sold these bonds to uninformed customers. 29 30 Larger investors are forced to settle their own disputes. 31 In the face of its contribution to enabling a cycle of shoddy home loans resulting in massive foreclosures, declining housing prices, deteriorating ratings of bond insurers, and lack of liquidity due to shaken confidence in the markets, Standard & Poor’s demonstrates a curious combination of arrogance and truthiness. The markets have nothing to replace the rating agencies other than individual initiative. Rating agencies are currently protected by government regulation, barriers to entry, institutionalized investor reliance, and the profit margin of approximately 40 percent that they make on their traditional business of rating corporate credits. As maddening as the recent actions of the rating agencies might seem, they are like a fellow who knowingly sells a horse to an investment banker named Black Bart. Without investors’ money funneled through investment banks to predatory mortgage lenders, the problems would have died an early death. It is very convenient for investment banks that Congress and the SEC are focused on the rating agencies, because investment banks—not the rating agencies—are the securities dealers obliged to perform due diligence appropriate to the circumstances. The rating agency business will probably pull in steady business in the future because the market has nothing to replace them. That does not mean, however, that the market is satisfied with the cartel’s performance. Warren Buffett avoids interfering with the management of the companies with which he invests but he made an unprecedented statement during his European excursion to find new investments. In May 2008, he said if Moody’s management did something wrong, “they should go.” 32 Weeks earlier, Warren told me he is “not proud” of Moody’s. One could say the same for Standard & Poor’s and Fitch. Misleading ratings contributed to the global market meltdown, because many financial institutions used “high” ratings as a sign of “safety” to justify their use of excessive leverage.",

        "text": "Chapter 8 Bear Market (I’d Like a Review of the Bidding) It’s easy to put on leverage, but not as easy to take it off. —Warren Buffett (Wall Street Journal, April 30, 2007) I n 2007, both Warren and I thought many hedge funds were overleveraged. If the book value of Berkshire Hathaway stock falls 5 percent, investors have “lost” 5 percent for the moment, but Berkshire Hathaway’s strong earning power (from subsidiaries and investments) will likely cause the price to rise satisfactorily again in the future. Berkshire Hathaway has value and its value is growing.A leveraged hedge fund that invests in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) can only rely on those CDOs for “earnings.” If the CDOs deteriorate due to, say, defaults on the loans backing them, there is permanent value destruction. There is no bouncing back from that. Furthermore, leverage magnifies the losses for investors. Bear Stearns Asset Management managed two hedge funds that provided classic examples. On January 30, 2007, Jim Melcher of Balestra Capital (a $100 million hedge fund) and I appeared on CNBC to discuss hidden price deterioration in subprime CDOs. Diana Olick, CNBC’s Washington-based real estate correspondent taped the segment. Olick may be the best reporter on any channel on this topic; she closely followed developments before the mortgage meltdown was big news. She reported that housing prices were softening and had risen only 1 percent the previous year for existing homes against the double-digit increases of the prior few years. Subprime mortgage loans had reached around $1.3 trillion in outstanding loans of the total $11 trillion (at the time) U.S. mortgage market. The foreclosure rate was already 13 percent (in the years before the 2005 risky loan explosion delinquency rates were in the low to mid-single digits) and climbing fast and steeply for more recent (2006) vintages. Based on my projections, foreclosure rates for subprime loans made in 2006 could reach 30 percent and recovery rates would probably be only around 30 cents on the dollar. This was based on my experience during other times of severe mortgage loan stress combined with poor underwriting standards. This meant that recent subprime loan securitizations were in trouble. Most investment-grade-rated residential mortgage-backed securities were in serious trouble at the lower levels, and the AAA tranches did not have enough protection to merit that rating. CDOs compounded the problem and CDO-squared products amplified it further. For those deals, even the AAA tranches had significant risk of substantial losses. I told Olick that investors who bought non-Fannie Mae and non-Freddie Mac securitizations should be very worried. Deals were overrated and overpriced, and prices would plummet. Jim Melcher was short the ABX index, the ABX HE 2 06 BBB- series, to profit on overrated and overpriced subprime-backed CDOs. He had tripled his money the prior two months and was one of the few hedge fund managers willing to publicly discuss the trade. He hung on anticipating further profits. I explained to CNBC that one didn’t even need to own the securitizations, you could have a gain “if the price in someone else’s portfolio takes a hit.” 1 Ralph Cioffi, a senior managing director of Bear Stearns Asset Management and a former colleague, had seen the segment and gave me unsolicited feedback.“You sounded good,” he said,“and you looked mahvelous as Billy Crystal used to say.”When his leveraged hedge funds failed a few months later, I wondered if he had listened to the content. In early February 2007, the shares of aggressive subprime mortgage lender, New Century Financial Corp., then the second largest subprime in the United States, plummeted after it alerted that it was short of cash. London-based HSBC Holdings Plc, the largest bank by market value in Europe, unexpectedly reported that it had $1.8 billion of losses due to subprime lending. 2 Bear Stearns’ fixed income research gave the horrific news a positive spin indicating that the worst might be over and recommended customers go long —the opposite of Jim Melcher’s short money-making position. 3 ResMae Mortgage Corporation went bankrupt on February 13, 2008, the day after Bear Stearns Fixed Income Research issued its report. ResMae was selling assets for mere pennies on the dollar. 4 By the end of February 2007, New Century was trading at around $15 per share, after its share price fell around 50 percent during the prior three weeks. Rumors circulated that the lender was in its death throes. Perhaps Bear Stearns didn’t get the memo, even though it had a “longstanding” 5 relationship financing New Century’s mortgage operation. On March 1, 2007, Scott R. Coren, a Bear Stearns stock analyst, upgraded New Century, saying that $10 per share would be the downside risk, if New Century needed rescuing. About a week later, New Century announced it had probably been unprofitable during the last six months of 2006 and needed to restate its earnings. Lenders yanked their credit lines. In April 2007, New Century filed for bankruptcy, joining more than 100 failed mortgage lenders. Countrywide, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, also showed signs of strain. Hidden leverage threatened the global markets. Many hedge funds used CDOs’ artificially high ratings as an excuse to leverage their “safe highly rated” investments. It is an extremely risky proposition. Debt purchased near full price has little or no price upside, but there is a lot of room for the price to go down when things go wrong. Combine that with leverage, and you have a very risky strategy. What if prices drop because everyone finds out that the assets are overrated? What if prices drop because of defaults by overextended homeowners, defaults due to a collapse in housing prices, or permanent value destruction due to fraud? There is no other income to give you upside potential, and a leveraged position has no hope of springing back. If a fund does not have gobs of liquidity in reserve, investor capital is quickly wiped out. Investors take a stomach-churning toboggan ride straight down risk’s icy slope. Creditors that lent the fund money to buy assets are lucky if they do not lose money, too. Most of us use high degrees of leverage when we buy a home. A homeowner might buy a $1 million dollar home and mortgage $900,000 of the purchase. If the price drops to $950,000, the “homeowner” loses $50,000 of his initial equity of $50,000, or 50 percent of his equity. If the price drops to $900,000, the “homeowner” loses all of his initial investment. If a bank forecloses on the $900,000 mortgage, it does not even break even after fees. If the price drops below $900,000, the bank’s cushion of the first loss taken by the “homeowner’s” $100,000 is gone, and the bank, the creditor, will not get the full amount of the loan paid back. Some of the mortgage loans made in 2006 and 2007 had zero money down, were made against aggressively appraised homes, and defaulted almost immediately. The investors in the hedge funds are like the homeowners that make a down payment (the investor had equity in the hedge fund), and investment banks (that give the lines of credit to hedge funds) are like the bank that gives out the mortgage. If asset prices drop and wipe out investors’ equity, the investment bank is next in line to take losses on its credit lines. Many hedge funds use total return swaps, a type of credit derivative, in order to borrow money and leverage up their investments.Warren saw the negative consequences of this strategy first-hand with Long-Term Capital Management.Total return swaps easily thwart the intent of margin requirements, they create much more leverage, and it is virtually invisible. At the end of April 2007,Warren told Susan Pulliam at the Wall Street Journal that the global financial system is so leveraged that it makes the leverage used before the Crash of 1929 “look like a Sunday-school picnic.” 6 I told her that if cash-strapped funds are forced to sell assets in a market downturn it “could lead to a vicious cycle of selling that would feed on itself.” 7 The collateral the hedge funds put up to back their borrowings is often illiquid and difficult to trade, and prime brokers such as Credit Suisse and JPMorgan do not disclose the amount of total-return swaps that they have made to hedge funds on their books.The strategy is very risky since the assets a hedge fund “buys” may come back on the balance sheet of the bank (the lender) if the fund implodes. For example, if a hedge fund uses 15 times leverage, and asset prices irreversibly drop just a tiny amount, investors lose some principal. If prices irreversibly drop just seven percent or more, investor capital is wiped out, and creditors have no choice but to seize the assets, some of which were sold by the investment banks in the first place. Regulators fed the folly.Within days of Warren’s warning, the New York Fed claimed that despite market similarities to the risk levels at the time just before LTCM blew up, there were different causes then, so the existing market environment now was less alarming. 8 England’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) piled on pablum. The FSA released results from a partial survey of hedge funds and thought that “average” leverage had declined. 9 Dr. Sam Savage coined the term “flaw of averages.” He asserts that using an average number to forecast an outcome can lead to huge errors. For example, if a swimming pool’s average depth is four feet, but the deep end of the pool is eight feet, a nonswimmer is presented with lethal risk. A drowning man learns the hard way that the “average depth” mischaracterizes the peril. The average leverage number might suggest that hedge funds on balance are safer, but if an individual hedge fund employs a high degree of leverage, the average for all hedge funds is meaningless. Furthermore, hedge funds had massive hidden risks—inherently risky overrated assets. On May 7, 2007, I wrote the Financial Times that the regulators were dead wrong.The current situation was not less alarming that that presented by LTCM, it was more alarming. Hidden leverage does not show up by polling prime brokers. Hedge funds, structured investment vehicles, and other investors use structured products combined with derivatives and leverage, “illiquid structured products will experience a classic collateral crash when hedge funds try to liquidate these assets to meet margin calls.” 10 A few weeks later, Bear Stearns Asset Management proved my point. In May 2007, Ralph Cioffi was the senior managing director of Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), a subsidiary of Bear Stearns, and cochief executive officer of Everquest Financial Ltd., a private financial services company. He reported to Richard Marin, the chairman and chief executive officer of BSAM. Warren Spector, cochief operating officer of Bear Stearns and a former trader of exotic mortgage products, was the key sponsor of Bear Stearns’ foray into hedge funds. Bear Stearns Asset Management managed several CDOs and it also managed several hedge funds. Before the summer of 2007 ended, my former colleagues Ralph Cioffi and Warren Spector (along with Richard Marin) lost their positions due to CDO investments combined with leverage in hedge funds managed by BSAM. I had worked at Bear Stearns in the late 1980s and remembered amiable newcomer Ralph Cioffi to be Bear Stearns’ most talented and successful salesman of mortgage-backed securities. He was usually even tempered, always hard working, and thoughtful. I headed marketing for the quantitative group run by both Stanley Diller, one of the original Wall Street “quants,” and Ed Rappa (now CEO of R.W. Pressprich & Co, Inc.), a managing partner. Ralph was a popular salesman with my colleagues and a heavy user of our quantitative research. In gratitude for analytical work that helped him make sales, Ralph presented our group with an $800 portable bond calculator purchased out of his own pocket. When I was lured away from Bear Stearns by Goldman Sachs, Ralph Cioffi tried to persuade me to stay, matching the offer. Around 20 years had passed and since then we occasionally stayed in touch, but we were not close friends. I knew Warren Spector, too. He had been a talented trader of exotic mortgage products, which at the time meant collateralized mortgage obligations including the volatile interest-only and principal-only slices of those deals. He had come a long way from the somewhat awkward young man who spilled red wine all over a white linen tablecloth at one of our client dinners. Before CDOs undid his career, he was a Bear Stearns favored son with a good shot at taking over Jimmy Cayne’s position as CEO. We did not correspond. However, a couple of years previously I shared my concerns with Spector about a call I received from a fund representative. He claimed that Bear Stearns had agreed to underwrite his firm’s securitization backed by life insurance policies. The macabre idea was that when policyholders died, investors got the money from the life insurance policies net of expenses and fees—very heavy fees. Documents posted on the SEC’s Web site showed that if the holders of the life insurance policies did not die before additional money was needed to pay ongoing policy premiums, investors would be asked for more money. Investors could lose more than their initial investment if policyholders inconvenienced them by living a long life. I had done a quick background check on the fund representative. The SEC was conducting an investigation and alleged that the fund representative’s former employer was a Ponzi scheme. My concerns were bad news to Warren Spector as well. He checked into it and I missed his return call, so he left me a voice message: “There are lots of people peddling this idea and it’s extremely unlikely that we will do anything with any of them, so I appreciate knowing who’s dropping our name.” The last time I spoke to Warren Spector, we discussed the hedging of synthetic CDOs that were constructed using credit derivatives. Bear Stearns’ proprietary trading desk had large derivatives positions with a number of investment banks. After JPMorgan Chase purchased Bear Stearns, the New York Fed estimated that Bear had around 750,000 derivatives contracts outstanding. 11 Based on what I knew, I thought Bear Stearns had scary volume in tricky credit derivatives. Keeping track of the true risk and long-term profit is a complex task. As I discussed with Warren Spector, any manager would have difficulty determining whether traders were actually making money (or losing money) relative to a risk-neutral fully hedged position. One could temporarily create huge revenues, but enormous risk could soon turn revenues into losses. In contrast, Warren Buffett worked hard to reduce the number and complexity of derivatives contracts owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Warren Buffett told me that after years of whittling down Gen Re’s derivatives positions, he knows (and understands) every derivative contract owned by Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett and Spector are very different Warrens. Warren Buffett used derivatives to turn junk into gold.Warren Spector oversaw at least one Bear Stearns affiliate (BSAM) that turned “high grade” into junk. Among other hedge funds, Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM) managed the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies fund. By August 2006, the fund had a couple of years of double-digit returns. BSAM launched the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage fund taking advantage of the first fund’s “success.” There must be more money! Both funds managed by BSAM included CDO and CDO-squared tranches backed in part by subprime loans and other securitizations (collateralized loan obligations) backed by corporate loans and leveraged corporate loans. In August 2006 when BSAM was setting up the Enhanced Leverage fund, other hedge fund managers (like John Paulson), shorted subprime-backed investments. Investors in the two funds managed by BSAM had been getting double-digit annualized returns on high-grade debt at a time when treasuries were yielding less than 5 percent. In fixed income investments, that usually means investors are taking risk. Ralph seemed to have similar views to mine on CPDOs, the leveraged product that I had said did not deserve a AAA rating. Ralph told me he thought the AAA rating could “lull the unsophisticated investor to sleep,” and that for the purposes of his hedge funds, if he liked an investment-grade-rated trade he could have the same trade without paying fees and “easily lever up . . . fifteen times.” To paraphrase Warren Buffett, if the price of your investments drops, leverage will compound your misery. On May 9, 2007, Matt Goldstein called and asked me if I had a chance to look at the registration statement for a new initial public stock offering (IPO) called Everquest Financial, Ltd (Everquest). Everquest is a private company formed in September 2006, and the registration statement was a required filing in preparation for its going public.The shares were held by private equity investors, but the IPO would make shares available to the general public. 12 Everquest was jointly managed by Bear Stearns Asset Management Inc, and Stone Tower Debt Advisors LLC, an affiliate of Stone Tower Capital LLC. I was curious, but I was swamped. I told him no, I was very busy and had not even had a chance to glance at it. He called again asking if I had seen it, and again I said no, “Go away.” Then Jody Shenn of Bloomberg left a voice message about Everquest, but I was still busy. The next morning I ignored Matt’s voice mails, but finally took his call the afternoon of Thursday, May 10, telling him that I still had not looked at the registration statement and had no plans to do so that day. My first call on the morning of Friday, May 11, 2007, was again from Matt Goldstein. He thought the IPO might be important. I went to the SEC’s Web site, and as I scanned the document I thought to myself: Has Bear Stearns Asset Management completely lost its mind? There is a difference between being clever and being intelligent.As I printed out the document to read it more thoroughly, I put aside the rest of my work and said: “Matt, you are right; this is important.” I was surprised to read that funds managed by BSAM invested in the unrated first loss risk (equity) of CDOs. In my view, the underlying assets were neither suitable nor appropriate investments for the retail market. I did not have time for a thorough review, so I picked a CDO investment underwritten by Citigroup in March 2007 13 bearing in mind that if the Everquest IPO came to market, some of the proceeds would pay down Citigroup’s $200 million credit line. Everquest held the “first loss” risk, usually the riskiest of all of the CDO tranches (unless you do a “constellation” type deal with CDO hawala ), and it was obvious to me that even the investors in the supposedly safe AAA tranches were in trouble. Time proved my concerns warranted, since the CDO triggered an event of default in February 2008, at which time Standard & Poor’s downgraded even the original safest AAA tranche to junk. The equity is the investment with the most leverage, the highest nominal return, and is the most difficult to accurately price. The CDO equity investments were from CDOs underwritten by UBS, Citigroup, Merrill, and other investment banks. 14 Based on what I read, Everquest’s original assets had significant exposure to subprime mortgage loans, and the document disclosed it, “a substantial majority of the [asset-backed] CDOs in which we hold equity have invested primarily in [residential mortgage-backed securities] backed by collateral pools of subprime residential mortgages.” 15 Based on my rough estimates, it was as high as 40 percent to 50 percent. If that was not bad enough, there was huge moral hazard. Bear Stearns Asset Management provided the assumptions for valuing the CDOs. Small changes in the assumptions could create huge differences in prices. Greg Parseghian, formerly of Freddie Mac, was listed as one of the outside directors of Everquest. 16 Among the many criticisms levied against Freddie Mac (due to events at the time Parseghian worked there) was its failure to use third-party assumptions instead of concocting its own, thus exposing itself up to moral hazard. Parseghian’s bosses left under a cloud, and he was promoted to CEO of Freddie Mac. Parseghian himself stepped down after a couple of months. OFHEO—the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight—then Freddie Mac’s regulator, said that before Parseghian’s promotion to CEO, he “failed to provide the Board with adequate information . . . to make an informed decision” in regard to some transactions. In this respect Parseghian’s actions illustrated Freddie Mac’s “culture of minimal disclosure.” 17 BSAM earned management fees for the hedge funds, management fees on some of the CDOs, and fees for managing Everquest. If Everquest’s Board replaced the managers, it had to pay a “break-up” fee of one to three years worth of the management fees— breaking up’s so very hard to do. 18 The registration statement stated that one of the risks is “the inability of our financial models to forecast adequately the actual performance results.” 19 Yet, fees partially depended on performance. I explained my concerns to Matt in a general way. Among other concerns: (1) money from the IPO would pay down Everquest’s $200 million line of credit to Citigroup; (2) the loan helped Everquest buy some of its assets including CDOs and a CDO-squared from two hedge funds managed by BSAM, namely the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund that had been founded in 2003 and the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund (“Enhanced Leverage Fund”) launched in August 2006; and (3) the assets appeared to include substantial subprime exposure. Matt Goldstein posted his story on Business Week’s site later that day. Initially it was called: The Everquest IPO: Buyer Beware, but after protests from Bear Stearns Asset Management, BusinessWeek changed the title to Bear Stearns’ Subprime IPO. 20 I hardly think that pleased Bear Stearns more. Bloomberg ’s Jody Shenn also wrote an article on Everquest that day. I expressed to him that “the moral hazard . . . is just mind-boggling.” He noted that Lehman thought that CDO assets had lost $18 billion to $25 billion in value industrywide as mortgage delinquencies rose. I thought industrywide losses were already much larger, they just were not being reported. 21 Ralph Cioffi contacted me about the BusinessWeek article. He said that dozens of IPOs like Everquest had been done—mostly offshore so as not to deal with the SEC. According to Ralph, BSAM’s hedge funds and Stone Tower’s private equity funds would own about 70 percent of Everquest stock shares (equity), and they had no plans to sell “a single share at the IPO date.” They planned to use the IPO proceeds to pay down the Citigroup credit line and possibly buy out unaffiliated private equity investors. I responded that verbal assurances that there are no plans to sell a share at the IPO date are meaningless. Publicly traded shares can be sold anytime. But even if the funds kept their controlling shares, it was not good news. Retail investors would have only a minority interest, which would be a disadvantage if they had a dispute with the managers. Ralph claimed that subprime was “actually a very small percent of Everquest’s assets.” He reasoned that on a market value basis the exposure to subprime was actually negative because Everquest hedged its risk. Technically, Ralph might have been correct—but the registration statement for the Everquest IPO itself suggested otherwise: “The hedges will not cover all of our exposure to [securitizations] backed primarily by subprime mortgage loans.” 22 It is fine to talk about net exposure (left over after you protect yourself with a hedge), but one usually also discusses the gross exposure (of the assets you originally bought). Hedges cost money, so they can reduce returns. Ralph Cioffi said CDO equity is “freely traded and easily managed.” I countered that CDO equity may be easy for Ralph to value, but investment banks and forensic departments of accounting firms told me they have trouble doing it. I told him that if this were a CDO private placement, it would have to be sold to sophisticated investors and meet suitability requirements, but since it is in a corporation, it can be issued as an initial public offering (IPO) to the general public. It seemed to be a way around SEC regulations for fixed income securities, and it was not suitable for retail investors in my view. Ralph said he would talk to his lawyers about changing the IPO’s registration statement to add a line about third-party valuations. We seemed to be talking at cross purposes, since the registration statement already said that third-party valuation would occur at the time of underwriting.The problem with that was that the assumptions for pricing would be provided by a conflicted manager, and assumptions are critical in determining value. Moreover, on an ongoing basis, one had to rely on a conflicted management’s assumptions for pricing. Ralph did not seem to want to end the discussion, so I asked him if there was something he wanted me to do. He said it would be great if I issued a comment saying I was quoted “out of context,” that my being quoted in Business Week lent credibility to the article and was not helping me, and that I would be “better served” writing my own commentary. I ignored what I perceived to be a thinly veiled threat. I told him that if he wanted me to write a commentary, I would do a thorough job of raising all of the objections I had just raised with him. Ralph seemed unhappy, but my thinking he was a hedge fund manager from Night of the Living Dead was the least of his problems. At the end of January 2007, the Enhanced Leverage Fund had $669 million in investor capital and $12 billion in investments for a leverage ratio estimated at around 17 to 1. Some estimates said that leverage increased to more than 20 to 1 the following month as assets increased and capital decreased slightly. The less-leveraged fund was estimated to have been levered over 10 to 1, a high degree of leverage for risky assets. On May 15, just days after the Business Week article appeared, Bear Stearns asset management told investors in the Enhanced Leverage fund that April losses were 6.75 percent. Questions about both the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies and the Enhanced Leveraged fund flooded the marketplace. The funds’ credit line providers were alarmed. 23 24 25 Bear Stearns faced other challenges. In April 2007, Bear Stearns asked the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) to modify credit default swap documents to make it clear that it had the right to modify mortgage loan agreements. On the surface, trying to maximize recovery by allowing homeowners to stay in their homes while continuing to make payments is a good idea. Foreclosure costs are expensive, and one should try to minimize losses in any way possible. But Bear Stearns’s timing could not have been more unfortunate; it provoked its own public relations disaster. A few weeks later, more than 25 hedge funds led by John Paulson, the heavy shorter of the ABX index, all but accused Bear Stearns of seeking to manipulate the market. The seller of credit protection (perhaps Bear Stearns) on mortgage-backed securities, the other side of Mr. Paulson’s trade, could use its investment in residual or servicing rights on a mortgage-backed security to buy out and revive defaulted loans.The protection seller could buy a loan at par, instead of its deeply discounted price, and it would artificially prop up the prices of the trust investments and the underlying securities that made up the ABX and other indexes. Since a protection seller in a lower-rated index has a leveraged position, for a relatively small investment it would gain (or protect) tens of times what it paid out. John Paulson maintained that Bear Stearns was trying to avoid making billions of dollars in payments on credit default swaps. “We were shocked,” said Michael Waldorf, a vice president at Paulson’s firm: He said Bear Stearns introduced language that “would try to give cover to market manipulation.” 26 In March 2008, less than one year later, many market participants remembered Paulson’s concerns when Bloomberg revealed that assets backing the ABX indexes appeared wildly overrated and credit default protection sellers (perhaps Bear Stearns?) would possibly have to come up with more collateral to back these trades. Bear Stearns withdrew its request to ISDA for additional clarification, claiming it now realized that market participants understood its right to modify loans, but the damage was done.With voices stentorian, the hedge funds had given ISDA and the entire subprime market a vote of no confidence in the motivations of Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. Warren Buffett had admonished his managers not to do anything they wouldn’t want to read about in the newspapers. Bear Stearns and its affiliates were seeing themselves in the press constantly—and not in a good way. On June 6, 2007, Bear Stearns Asset Management froze redemptions on the approximately $600 million Enhanced Leveraged fund that had been founded the previous August, whereas up until then, investors were accustomed to withdrawing funds with 30-days notice. Its value had fallen 23 percent from the start of the year, and by June 7, BSAM restated its May 15 statement of April 2007 losses from a 6.75 percent loss to a loss of 18.97 percent. BSAM had little choice. Bear Stearns’s lenders: Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Merrill Lynch & Co., Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Barclays PLC, Dresdner Kleinwort, Deutsche Bank, and others had begun marking down the value of the funds’ assets and demanded more collateral; the banks made margin calls.The Enhanced Leverage fund faced $145 million of margin calls as of June 8, and the less-leveraged fund faced $63 million of its own margin calls. 27 Bear Stearns asked for forbearance. When that didn’t work, BSAM met with the funds’ lenders, and asked for a moratorium on margin calls and a return of derivative collateral back to the fund. In effect it was asking for more leverage and an extended loan. The meeting was punctuated with a breathtakingly arrogant flourish when BSAM distributed handouts ending with what it needed from the funds’ counterparties. The creditors were not rookies. They had expected BSAM to announce some sort of solution worked out in concert with its parent, Bear Stearns. Of all of the hedge fund managers in the world, the last thing they expected was that Bear Stearns Asset Management would ask them to bend over and think of Ben Bernanke. BSAM and Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. seemed unaware they had just made an enormous tactical error. They must have been walking around in a dissociative fugue. Bear Stearns Asset Management wanted new conditions from lenders? BSAM was worried about the prices its creditors might put on the assets it managed? The mood of at least one of the funds’ creditors had just shifted from “let’s see what they’ve come up with” to “#*?! those guys.” In 1994, Bear Stearns had been very quick—some said much too quick—off the mark to seize and liquidate exotic CMO collateral (the kind of assets Warren Spector traded early in his career) of three commingled funds managed by Askin Capital Management. Bear Stearns seemed to have made a fast profit—and a greater profit than the other creditors involved—after reselling seized assets. Despite David Askin’s belief that he could consistently produce returns as high as 15 percent in both up and down markets, he ran into pricing and liquidity problems. 28 At the end of February 1994, Askin did not use the mark-to-market prices supplied by Wall Street firms that had lent him money—including Bear Stearns—but a court-appointed trustee could not find Askin’s models, either. Askin’s disclosure to his investors the following month about not using dealer pricing was one of the triggers that sparked the market sell-off that led to that fund’s bankruptcy. 29 Questions were also raised about the prices used by the investment banks that eventually liquidated the assets they seized from the funds. The investment banks did not seem to be using a defensible model based on observable assumptions. Prices seemed to be arranged over the phone between dealers and designed to show a “print” for the records, since customer business had dried up. The prices became a market joke: I’m just Askin’ . . . What’s the price of this CMO? The final bankruptcy report for the Askin funds noted that Bear Stearns had a 12-hour head start and seemed to make much more profit than the other firms when it resold the assets it seized from Askin. The hasty liquidation may have made any attempt for a bailout moot. The report said Bear Stearns’s seizure and sale of collateral was “at prices below its own contemporaneous assessments of value.” 30 To be fair to Bear Stearns, we will never know how it came up with new prices over the phone on that day, since—despite a court order—Bear Stearns said it “inadvertently” 31 recorded over its trading floor telephone tapes several months after it was required to produce them. What happened to the evidence? We’re just Askin’. Bear Stearns was consistent in its take-no-hedge-fund-prisoners philosophy. In 1998, after Long-Term Capital Management turned down Warren Buffett’s bid, the New York Federal Reserve Bank helped arrange a bailout for LTCM with 16 banks and investment banks. James “Jimmy” E. Cayne, Bear Stearns’s CEO, famously refused to help. The rest of Wall Street never forgot it. The head of risk management for J.P. Morgan wasn’t askin’ anything when he pointed out to Ralph Cioffi and his boss Richard Marin that they might have to seek help from Bear Stearns, their parent company, to figure out a way to meet margin calls. He thought they were “underestimating the severity of the situation.” When you are playing for keeps in finance, you dispense with insults such as “you’re a lying scumbag , ” and replace it with something along the lines of “you are gravely mistaken” —meaning take it back, or there will be war. On June 23, 2007, Richard Marin later wrote on his blog, Whim of Iron ( whimofiron.blogspot.com ), that he had spent the previous two weeks defending “Sparta against the Persians [sic] hordes of Wall Street.” One of my business contacts joked that Marin meant me, since my last name is a Persian name, an artifact of my ex-husband. But Marin seemed to be referring to the popular film, 300, about the battle at Thermopylae, in which a small army of Greeks perished after battling and delaying tens of thousands of Persians. Their sacrifice bought time for the Greek armies, who ultimately drove back their enemy. Marin thought he had prevailed, but like the doomed soldiers in the 300, he lost his battle to maintain his top position at BSAM. On June 29, 2007, Marin moved aside and became an advisor to Jeffrey Lane, BSAM’s new chairman and CEO, an import from Lehman Brothers. 32 Initially, Alan Schwartz and Warren Spector, Bear Stearns’s cochief operating officers, emphasized that they were not bailing out the funds. Ralph Cioffi tried to save the funds and announced to his creditors that he had hired a consultant, Blackstone’s Timothy Coleman, to help him restructure the funds. Blackstone owned a large private equity share of FGIC, a bond guarantor that insured risky subprime-backed CDOs (among other things). FGIC thought the tranches it insured were “safe,” but a fundamental analysis would have shown otherwise. In June 2007, FGIC was still rated AAA, but ironically, it was downgraded to junk in March 2007, just a few days before Bear Stearns failed. 33 There was talk of Bear Stearns coming to the rescue with a $2.5 billion loan. “People close to the situation” 34 claimed that losses would have little impact on Bear Stearns.They were wrong. On June 15, Merrill Lynch seized collateral and others began testing the market. The news was dismal. Even though most of the assets on bid lists were nominally rated AAA, only some of assets fetched prices close to asking prices. Others were less than 50 cents on the dollar, and some of the harder to sell assets were not even shown around. Many people were angry that BSAM had not managed the funds better. Now that the bid lists were hitting the market, it would be harder than ever to avoid marking down the investment banks’ enormous exposures to CDOs. Bid lists from JPMorgan Securities and Morgan Stanley found their way to Reuters. It counted $1.44 billion in CDOs. Managers included Tricadia, headed by Michael Barnes, an alumnus of the Bear Stearns’s mortgage department and later UBS, Cohen Brothers’ Strategos—later to distinguish itself with highest notional amount of defaulted CDOs, and BSAM. 35 36 Among the funds’ assets were collateralized loan obligations partially backed by leveraged loans.The SEC had several pricing investigations underway into these types of securitizations. The leveraged loan market had not been getting as much attention as the mortgage market, but collateral quality was mixed. Some loans had assets backing them, and some did not. Investment banks looked at the bid lists and saw that they did not have time to drill down into the loans to figure out how to bid. 37 By late June, Bear Stearns said it would invest $1.6 billion to bailout the Enhanced Leverage fund. BSAM had already begun reducing leverage. Bear Stearns also stated that the less-leveraged Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies fund would not need to be rescued. 38 By not stepping up immediately, Bear Stearns let BSAM circulate asset lists that aired Wall Street’s dirty laundry. At the end of June 2007 I told the Wall Street Journal’s Serena Ng that the poor bids raised the question of why investment banks were not reporting losses, and no one wanted to ask the question. “That would open the floodgates. Everyone is trying to stop the problem, but they should face up to it. The assets may all be mispriced.” 39 It wasn’t as if the coming market mess could have been avoided. Bear Stearns simply had the misfortune of an arrogant past, and now it was the first to show everyone’s losing cards. By the end of June, Bear Stearns’s share price closed just under $139 per share, down 15 percent for the year. The worst was yet to come. As Warren Buffett joked to me during lunch, you cannot multiply your investments when you multiply by zero. Bear Stearns had only bailed out creditors, not fund investors. By mid-July, Bear Stearns told investors in the Enhanced Leverage fund that they would probably get back nothing. Investors in the less-leveraged fund were told they would probably get only 10 cents on the dollar. 40 In the eyes of some investors, Bear Stearns Asset Management went from hero to zero. Iain Hamilton, a portfolio manager for Infiniti Capital, a fund of funds in Zurich that had invested a 3.25 percent allocation in BSAM managed hedge funds, felt misled. At a conference in Sydney, Hamilton exclaimed that BSAM represented the subprime exposure was “6 percent, but it had 40 percent hidden elsewhere.” 41 He could take losses. He had losses in another fund, but hadn’t felt misled. According to him, it was misrepresentation. Whether this was a misunderstanding of net versus gross exposures, or something else, will have to be decided by the courts. Ralph Cioffi left Bear Stearns by mutual agreement on November 28, 2007, at the age of 51. His compensation reportedly soared to eight figures during his BSAM days. The less-leveraged fund had positive returns for several years, and colleagues invested money with him after noting he was returning around 1 percent per month—more than 12 percent per year—in an interest rate environment in which 10-year Treasuries were yielding less than 5 percent. It was an old story: If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Warren Spector did not last as long as Cioffi. Like Warren Buffett, Warren Spector and Jimmy Cayne are avid bridge players. On August 5, 2007, Spector became the highest ranking bridge player—one of the world’s top 300 contract bridge players—to lose his job over the mortgage lending crisis. Bridge is a great comfort in your old age. If it distracts you from business, it can help you get there faster. Spector had been the lead promoter for Bear Stearns to get into the hedge fund business, and Cayne held him responsible. Cayne’s ire may also have been sparked by the fact that while the funds faltered in July, Spector was at a bridge tournament playing perfect hands of bridge and racking up 100 master points. Cayne played less well at the same bridge tournament, and apparently he thought Spector should have been closer to the hedge fund problem, even if Cayne himself did not feel compelled to fly back to New York. Unlike Cayne, Spector had sold millions of shares of his Bear Stearns stock in 2004. Bloomberg reported that Spector, 51, earned $228 million in cash from 1992 to 2006, and got another $372 million when he cashed in most of his Bear Stearns shares. 42 Jimmy Cayne, 74, resigned in January of 2008, after serving 15 years as CEO. His Bear Stearns stock had been worth more than $975 million in January 2007 and was worth around half of that when he resigned in January 2008. Cayne did not liquidate until after JPMorgan’s March 2008 takeover. The stock was worth only $61 million. Cayne may feel lucky in comparison to Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, Ralph’s cohead at BSAM. On June 18, 2008, they were indicted on allegations of securities fraud, among other charges . 43 44 Prosecutors focused on electronic exchanges between Tannin and Cioffi. The partners may have stumbled over the truth, picked themselves up, and hurried on. In late April, they saw a negative report prompting Tannin to write to Cioffi: “If the report was [sic] true, the entire subprime market was toast.” 45 Yet they did not seem to share those concerns with investors. Perhaps the partners gave themselves unwarranted reassurance. It reminded me of a bridge joke I sent Warren Buffett after our lunch. It was a partnership misunderstanding. My partner thought I knew what I was doing.",

        "text": "Introduction O kay, so you bought this book looking for hints about performing business analysis. Or maybe you’re still in the bookstore thinking about whether this book is going to be of any value to you as a business analyst. (Hint: It is.) You may be working as a business analyst now or wondering whether it’s the right job for you. As a career path, business analysis is a good option. Companies today need business analysis performed so they can solve problems, take advantage of opportunities, make sure they’re chasing the most cost-effective solutions, and streamline efficiency. The good news is that the skills needed to address these concerns are learnable. With even basic knowledge, you can immediately help a company reach its goals. You can make a difference today in the success of your (or someone else’s) business. However, one of the challenges you face as a business analyst (BA) is that it isn’t black and white; the standard BA answer to almost any question is, “It depends.” Business analysis deals with a lot of variables and changing conditions, which means you have to practice a lot to get good at it. The more you experience, the better you get. Business Analysis For Dummies brings together a lot of experience in one place to help you get a head start and jump in right away. About This Book Part of business analysis is about setting general expectations for the project results and being educated in various techniques and principles, and this book is right in line with that philosophy. No book about business analysis can possibly explain every situation and every approach you may find yourself in. You have to do a certain amount of figuring it out as you go along. What this book does give you are tools and techniques you can use to set your expectations. We provide tips and starting points for communication with stakeholders and even explain what business analysis terms like stakeholder mean. This book is a reference tool you can turn to in order to understand what particular aspect of business analysis you’re looking for. The beauty of it is that you don’t have to read through the entire book cover to cover to get the information you want out of it. You can simply open to the table of contents, find what you’re looking for, and head directly to that section without passing Go or collecting $200. Here’s a taste of the useful reference material you can expect to find in Business Analysis For Dummies: How to determine whether someone is giving you a solution disguised as a requirement and how to find the root cause of the problem ( Chapter 6 ) Why you have to understand what is driving the business to undertake the project and know whether proceeding is a good decision ( Chapter 8 ) How to create multiple solutions for a problem (or take an advantage of an opportunity) and recommend which one the business should undertake ( Chapter 9 ) How to find and maintain the boundaries of a project so you know exactly what you are (and aren’t) working on ( Chapter 10 ) The great thing about this book is that we let you know exactly what information is vital and what’s nonessential. We’ve packed the main body with all the stuff we think you really need to know, but you can skip items like sidebars (shaded boxes) and Technical Stuff paragraphs. These bits are interesting, but you won’t miss out on vital information if you choose to pass them by. All web addresses appear in monofont . As you read, you may note that some web addresses break across two lines of text. If you're reading this book in print and want to visit one of these web pages, simply key in the web address exactly as it's noted in the text, pretending that the line break doesn't exist. If you're reading this as an e-book, you've got it easy — just click the web address to be taken directly to the web page. And one business analysis-specific note: We use BA, business analyst, and business analysis professional interchangeably to describe the person doing this type of work — just as these terms are used in real life. Know, though, that “business analyst” is a general descriptor rather than a professional title. Business analysis is performed at all levels of a company. Even mom-and-pop shops need to perform business analysis, but they don’t necessarily hire an outside business analyst; someone on their staff performs the business analysis work. In this book, that person is as much a BA as someone who has “business analyst” printed on her business card. Foolish Assumptions Business analysis is full of assumptions (though BAs have their own definition of assumption ). Seeing as how we’re so accustomed to assumptions, we make a few about you as our readers: You need to perform business analysis to do your job, whether you have the title “business analyst” or not. You know how to read documents and search for information (the fact that you’re reading this book to gain information confirms that assumption). You can (or need to learn how to) ask tough questions, communicate with people both electronically and face to face, and get up in front of a group to present an idea. You’re constantly willing to increase your business analysis skills and to look at different ways to accomplish things. Icons Used in This Book Look for these familiar For Dummies icons to offer visual clues about the kinds of material you’re about to read: This icon points out good advice relating to the subject matter you’re reading about. Skimming these paragraphs gives you some seriously good suggestions that can help you utilize resources efficiently and make your work just a little easier! The decisions you make and information you present can have a profound impact on the business. For that reason, we highlight important business analysis concepts and principles with this icon. Consider these bits the extra-important paragraphs you’ll want to come back to. Read these paragraphs to avoid BA pitfalls that may result in poor customer satisfaction and solutions that just don’t hit the mark. This icon appears beside information that’s interesting but that won’t impair your understanding of business analysis if you skip it. The Anecdote icon calls out our attempts to show you how a particular BA technique has been applied in the real world. We have had more than 50 years of experience among us, so we want to share our success (and horror) stories with you so you can benefit from (or just chuckle at) them. Beyond the Book In addition to the material in the print or e-book you’re reading right now, this product also comes with some goodies you can access on the web. No matter how diligently you prepare, execute, and follow the business analysis guidelines we offer in this book, you’ll probably come across a few situations that stump you. Check out the free Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/business analysis for an overview of a project's lifecycle; 15 indicators that can point you to areas that are ripe for process improvement; and a checklist that helps you perform a business impact analysis, which lets you target the project worthy of your efforts and the business's resources. Head to www.dummies.com/extras/businessanalysis to find pointers on conducting a requirements review, a process that gets you to the heart of an issue by asking one simple question, and advice for developing a good relationship with your project manager. Where to Go from Here The book is about as modular as you can get with business analysis, meaning you don’t have to read one chapter to understand what happens in the next. If you’re looking for a specific keyword you heard a manager use or a new technique you saw another BA use in a meeting, you can use the index or table of contents as your guide and skip right to the appropriate chapter to read about it. We’ve organized this book so that you can jump in wherever you want, so if you want to skip to the end and read the short chapters in Part V first, go right ahead. You find lots of good information presented in easy-to-digest nuggets there, and who knows — these pearls of wisdom may inspire you to go back to find the more detailed, how-to info in the main chapters themselves. If you’re totally new to business analysis, start at Part I. Chapter 3 is a good landing point if you want to brush up on the people side of the business. Want to find out about making a business case? Head to Chapter 9 . For help figuring out what the problems are to begin with, your starting point is Chapter 6 . If you need to cut right to the chase and implement solutions effectively, try Chapters 12 and 13 . The easiest way, though, to use the book is to just start turning pages and read the content! And because the true value is in how you apply it to real life, don’t be shy about making notes in the chapters, highlighting information, and putting flags on the pages. Whether you’re using sticky notes or your e-reader’s highlighter function, this book is one of the first tools in your BA toolkit; refer to it often!",

        "text": "Chapter 1 Business Analysis in a Nutshell In This Chapter Grasping what business analysis is and why it’s valuable Tracking a business analyst’s role and skills Introducing industry guidelines and certification options I n today’s competitive world, companies must always be at their best, maintain an edge, and capitalize on opportunities for growth. Business analysis is a deliberate attempt to review operations to ensure that business is moving along as well as it can and that the company is taking advantage of opportunities. Basically, business analysis is a set of tasks and activities that help companies determine their objectives for meeting certain opportunities or addressing challenges and then help them define solutions to meet those objectives. Sometimes, companies hire outside, independent business analysts (BAs) to come in and perform the analysis. Other times, they may call upon an employee to perform BA tasks internally regardless of whether he has a business analyst title. No matter which category you fit into, this book lays it all out for you. In this chapter, we give you a very broad overview of what business analysis is, introduce you to the business analysis lifecycle, and explain what the job entails. Defining Business Analysis According to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) version 2, business analysis is the “set of tasks and techniques used to work as a liaison among stakeholders in order to understand the structure, policies, and operations of an organization, and to recommend solutions that enable the organization to achieve its goals.” Translation: Your goal as a BA is to understand how companies work and to enable companies to reach their potential by helping them articulate and meet goals, recognize and take advantage of opportunities, or identify and overcome challenges. All of which is a pretty tall order. But the task becomes more manageable — and understandable — if you think of it as having two distinct parts: the goal and the process. The goal: The goal addresses why you’re doing the analysis in the first place — perhaps to improve a company’s revenue and services or to reduce its costs. Think of the goal as the purpose of the project. In order to determine what the real goal is, you often have to employ the most frequently asked question in the world of business analysis: “Why?” Although we go into much deeper detail later in the book about discovering the goal of a project, the process really can be as simple as asking “why” until you’ve gotten to the root of the issue. (This fact is one reason we feel a 4-year-old is the best business analysis professional around.) The process: The process involves understanding the how — that is, understanding what the solution needs to do, what it should look like, and the people or systems that interact with it. The process requires you to grasp where the company is today and where it needs to be in order to achieve the goal. During this part, you determine what the solution should look and feel like and how to make sure it’s used after developed. To develop the process, you basically break the goal down into manageable pieces that you and the company can execute. Those manageable pieces make up the solution. In business analysis, you do not actually perform the activities to build the solution, nor do you actually manage the process to build the solution or test the solution. Instead, you identify the activities that enable the company (with your expert help, of course) to define the business problem or opportunity, define what the solution looks like, and define how it should behave in the end. As the BA, you lay out the plans for the process ahead. Knowing Your Role in the Basic Business Analysis Lifecycle Business analysis work is done at many levels within a company. From the chief executive officer (CEO) and vice presidents to the line managers, individuals throughout the company use business analysis activities throughout their day. Because folks at all levels view things in terms of a project (a set of steps to accomplish something), explaining business analysis activities as part of a project lifecycle (as shown in Figure 1-1 ) is easy. Although these tasks fall in a general order, they’re somewhat fluid, as we discuss in later chapters. For now, get to know this cycle; it’s at the crux of all things business analysis: 1.\tPlan the project. Planning includes creating a work plan or at least thinking through an approach for the analysis effort on a project, encompassing all the activities you do and the techniques you use. As the BA, your primary role during planning is determining the scope of the effort; if you’re a more senior BA, you may be involved in project estimation and resource planning. These additional tasks are detailed in Chapter 11 . 2.\tScope the project. Defining and documenting the project scope requires you to understand why the project has been initiated (the project statement of purpose ) and the goals of the project (the project objectives ). As the BA, you hold folks to the project boundaries and analyze the business problem without jumping to a solution. This step includes clearly identifying the opportunity or problem the company needs to address. Chapter 9 includes information on how to develop a business case, which also discusses the problem definition. For more on scoping, flip to Chapter 10 . 3.\tElicit, analyze, and communicate requirements. This step is the bulk of what business analysis professionals do at the project level. As the BA, you actively partake in understanding the real business needs and finding the root cause of business problems, as well as communicating requirements to the intended audience. This task involves categorizing the requirements and knowing how detailed they have to be to ensure your project is solving the right problem. We discuss requirements in Chapters 5 through 8. 4.\tDesign the solution. BAs aren’t typically responsible for this activity; rather, they collaborate with the solution team to develop a solution. Because solution design isn’t a core business analysis activity, we don’t cover it in this book. However, the fact that design doesn’t fall to you doesn’t mean you should walk away when the designing starts. Having the BAs available to support the design and development team is important. 5.\tBuild or buy the solution. Based on the activities in Steps 1 through 4, the business and project team make a decision to build the solution internally, have a group outside the company build it, or buy a prepackaged solution. During this time, your role is to ensure the solution still meets the business need stated in the project objectives and the business requirements. In addition, you may also start writing test cases and test scenarios for the next (test) phase. 6.\tTest the solution. As the solution is being designed and built, you need to validate that the business needs elicited during the project are being met. You collaborate with the test team, either as an active tester or by working with the testing team to ensure the solution meets the stated requirements and other project documentation. You can find out more about how to test solutions in Chapter 14 . 7.\tImplement the solution. After a solution is built, you need to help make sure the business uses the solution. You actively work with project stakeholders as the solution rolls out, perhaps as a change agent (advocating the need for change) and/or to train new users on the system. Part of the implementation may be eliciting metrics surrounding usability, noting how quickly they are adapting to the new system, and gauging customer satisfaction. We cover implementation in detail in Chapter 15 . 8.\tConduct a post-implementation review. After the solution has been implemented, you need to make sure the goals outlined in the project are being met. If they aren’t, another project may be necessary to address the gap. We detail post-implementation review in Chapter 14 . Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 1-1: A generic project lifecycle. Don’t confuse the post-implementation review with a “lessons learned” process. The latter generally discusses how you can do the project process better, not how well the solution works for the business. Looking at the Value of Business Analysis A popular perception of business analysis is that it makes businesses do business better. It’s simple but true, and BAs are the people who function as the liaisons between the problems and solutions to make businesses everywhere do business better. Here are just a few of the ways that your performance as a BA can help an organization: Setting expectations: BAs help stakeholders define a solution for their problem. After a solution has been defined — whether that solution is to build a four-bedroom, wheelchair-accessible, three-car-garage house or to improve a business process to reduce costs — expectations are set. The stakeholders (the future homeowners, the business owner/executives, or whoever) expect that whatever actions follow will result in the solution that was identified. Improving estimation: Most people don’t like surprises when it comes to time and cost estimates. Performing business analysis helps define what needs to be accomplished. Having this clearer picture lets organizations do a better job of estimating what their solutions will cost and how long they’ll take to implement. Better aligning projects with goals/objectives: Because business analysis professionals work on both the “why” and the “how” pieces, they can see when a solution is no longer aligned with the goals and objectives. Kupe was working on a project where the goal was to reduce employee time on a specific process for a utility company and therefore reduce salary costs associated with that process. He identified many parts of the process that could be automated, thereby reducing employee hours spent on the process. At one point, Kupe asked how many people performed a particular part of the process and how often, only to find that one person did it three times per year. Automating that part of the process would cost $10,000 . . . and save approximately 30 minutes of work time and $12 in salary cost per year. Automating this part of the process didn’t align to the goal of reducing costs, so Kupe convinced everyone not to automate. If you discover that the project work is no longer adding value to reaching the goals and objectives of the company, one of the best things you as the BA can do is cancel the project. Managing scope creep: Scope creep refers to the phenomenon of bringing in new requirements after everyone agrees on what should be included in a project. In companies where projects are going on all the time, scope creep is going to happen. Gain buy-in on the project scope from all impacted people as early as possible. Then, when scope creep happens, you can show the impact the new requirements would have so the business can make an informed decision. For example, say you’re on a project where you’re solving a productivity issue for one department of a company; halfway through, the company wants to include another department. In this case, you have to review the original scope with the company and outline how the added department will change the project so the decision-makers can determine whether to proceed with the change. Reducing project defects: Business analysis activities detail the rules, process, and user interactions of the solution. This level of detail helps provide clear direction for the people developing the solution and those testing the solution to help ensure that defects are reduced and caught before the solution is implemented. In a solution that enables customers to buy products from a website, for example, one of the required conditions would be that the customer must enter a complete address; the BA would then elicit requirements surrounding the expected experience from the customer’s viewpoint: Does the company cancel the order? Do the customers receive an error message? If so, what does the message say? Smoothing the transition to production: Transition as it relates to projects is all about moving from the development and test environment, where you’re building the solution, to the production environment, where the users are actually using the solution. Good business analysis includes ensuring the solution will be used in production, which you do by getting the organization ready for the change and developing a rollout strategy. Reusing requirements and reducing duplicate solutions: For every initiative, BAs should be careful not to duplicate requirements underway in different areas of the company. Because you often develop many solutions at the same time for the same goals and objectives, companies may well be working on multiple projects trying to accomplish the same thing. Kupe was working at an energy company that was trying to improve the operations of its four real estate divisions. Each division was independently trying to address the same need: updating the real estate database. By looking outside each individual group, Kupe and a team suggested combining efforts that could save time and money by focusing on one solution rather than four. Improving communication within the team: Business analysis activities boil down to communication. One of the BA’s main roles is to elicit and communicate the true needs of the business so the right solution can be delivered. Making sure everyone has a clear and consistent understanding of what needs to be accomplished helps ensure all sides are working together to accomplish the goal. Increasing customer satisfaction: BAs help address the inevitable changes a company goes through and can help mitigate any problems customers may feel as a result of those changes. One of the biggest ways you as a BA can help is by facilitating communication of the changes to customers. For example, if the company wants to make a change to its services or product, you can help it determine what the impact on the customers will be and how to effectively communicate the upcoming changes to those affected. Considering the Skills of a Successful BA When performing business analysis, you need to be equally proficient in several skills so you can apply them at different times based on the project you’re working on. But you can’t stop there; you also have to know when to use which skill. The following sections spell out a few skills you need to succeed at business analysis. Outstanding communication Communication is integral to everything in business analysis, so you need to be great at it. BAs operate at the intersection of business problems and business solutions, which means you have to be able to communicate with two groups of folks that sometimes seem to be speaking different languages. We cover more on communication in Chapter 3 . Detailed research, analysis, and recording BAs need to have the curiosity for understanding processes, procedures, and systems. They shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions. If you’re consistently the person in the room with your hand up when a presenter asks for question, you just may be cut out for work as a BA. Even if you know the subject matter well, you can still ask questions to understand it in more depth and detail. That curiosity helps you understand what each person needs from the project. The key isn’t just asking questions of other people; it’s wanting to understand all aspects about how something works or what the underlying problem is. Such curiosity could lead to conducting research on your own to figure out where the problem exists and then analyzing the issues and barriers that would create an effective solution. Time management and information organization If you ask a true BA when analysis is done, his answer will be “Never!” However, the reality is that you have a limited time to complete your project, so to be successful, you have to be able to effectively manage your work and be good at setting priorities. Because you’ll be dealing with a lot of people and a lot of information, you need to be good at organizing all the information in a way that lets you recall it when needed to support your communication. You need to understand which pieces of your elicited information are relevant to which stakeholders and how you are going to use what you found to communicate your results. The ability to see the big picture If you get close enough to an impressionist painting, all you see are brush strokes. Only as you move away from the painting can you start to see the image of a cathedral or a picnic. Being able to step away from the project at hand and see the big picture is crucial for any business analysis practitioner. You must be able to work on a project while understanding how that project fits in with other projects in the organization and continues to meet the business’s overall objectives. This macro view is a particularly important skill because the BA is typically the only person with this vital perspective. You’re the one who can keep efforts relevant, synergistic, and efficient. Once, a project Paul was a part of was being worked on by several smaller areas (or silos , in BA lingo) within one organization. He studied the entire end-to-end process — including the different silos — and discovered that multiple silos were creating the same data stores when having just one for everyone to access made more sense. Focusing on the big picture allowed Paul to catch the issue in time to get things back on track. Customer-focused and value-driven perspective To be a good BA, you must always keep in mind what your customer needs from you. That probably seems like a no-brainer, but keep in mind that we’re not just talking about external customers who purchase your organization’s products and services; we’re also referring to internal customers from other departments and even to those on your project team. With any of these customers, you have to make sure that whatever you produce provides value to the customer and to the project you’re working on. A large BA toolkit Abraham Maslow, the famous psychologist, once said, “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.” This concept led to the law of the instrument, or overreliance on one familiar tool. As a business analysis professional, you need to avoid falling victim to this law. By having a large toolkit, you can apply the right tool to the situation at hand. You have to know which tools work best based on the context and the situation. For instance, if you’re trying to model data, the best tool is to use an entity relationship diagram, not a workflow (more on data modeling in Chapter 13 ). If you need to show your stakeholders what your solution would look like in real life, you use a prototype ( Chapter 4 ). On the other hand, if stakeholders just need the nuts and bolts and bottom line of the project, you want to make sure you can write a strong business case ( Chapter 9 ). If you’re trying to make sure your project stays on track and doesn’t go out of bounds, you use your scoping diagram ( Chapter 10 ). In addition to the business analysis techniques covered in the book, you need to have a good grasp on the types of solutions specific to your business or field. For example, if you work in an area that develops web applications, you want to be familiar with and stay current on the features and functions that technology can deliver. Flexibility Don’t worry; nothing about business analysis requires you to take yoga classes. The flexibility we’re talking about here is the way you respond to changes on a project. Flexibility is important because the question isn’t whether changes will occur on a project; it’s when changes will occur. You need to be able to roll with the punches calmly and change gears swiftly. Scope can be expanded, new features discussed, and possibilities tossed around, all of which may lead to change. Refusing to change along with the project doesn’t bode very well for you as the BA or for the project team as a whole and may cause project defects. In fact, you probably have to be the most flexible because you’re at the center of the communication. You have to be able to adapt to changes on a project and adjust accordingly. The more quickly you accept the change, the more time you have to steer the project in the new direction. Flexibility isn’t just about being adaptable to changes to project requirements. You often have to be flexible when the human aspect of your project (such as team members) changes. Getting to Know the IIBA BABOK In 2003, a group of professionals involved with business analysis got together with a mission to help promote the profession, certify practitioners, and have a space for the community to share experiences and learn from each other. Thus, the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA) was born. Today, IIBA is responsible for maintaining the Guide to the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK Guide). The BABOK Guide describes business analysis areas of knowledge, associated activities, and the tasks and skills a BA must do/have in order to be effective. The BABOK Guide isn’t a BA how-to manual (which may be what led you to purchase this book). Instead, it’s a framework of six areas of knowledge: Business analysis planning and monitoring: Figuring out which activities are needed in order to perform the effort contained inside the project scope Elicitation: Getting information from stakeholders Requirements management and communication: Engaging the project team, sponsors, and stakeholders to keep them informed of project progress, scope alignment, changes to the scope, and the explanation of requirements Enterprise analysis: Finding and clarifying the real need to meet the strategic goals of the enterprise Requirements analysis: Classifying and prioritizing requirements in order to develop the solution Solution assessment and validation: Assessing which of the potential solutions best fits the business need and assessing the performance and effectiveness of the solution In addition to these knowledge areas, the BABOK Guide covers another, equally important area that isn’t considered a knowledge area: underlying competencies. Underlying competencies are skills an effective BA should have in order to perform as an effective business analyst. They consist of analytical thinking and problem solving, behavioral characteristics (such as ethics, trustworthiness, and personal organization), business knowledge, communication skills, interaction skills, and software application knowledge. (Many of these are the same as/related to the essential skills we discuss in the earlier section Considering the Skills of a Successful BA .) Pursuing Business Analysis Certification Why get certified? This is a question BAs are still discussing on business analysis chat forums, and there are a lot of reasons why. Basically, though, it comes down to showing you have the requisite skills and experience to be effective in performing business analysis in the industry. In other words, a certification verifies that that a third party — the IIBA — has recognized you have “the right stuff.” The IIBA began offering certifications in November 2006 and provides an industry certification that measures a BA's knowledge of the BABOK. IIBA currently offers two levels of certification: certification of competency in business analysis (CCBA) and certified business analysis professional (CBAP). You can find the specific requirements on the association's website at www.iiba.org . Many training vendors also offer certifications based on IIBA’s business analysis curriculum. For example, B2T Training’s curriculum aligns with the BABOK and helps prepare individuals for both IIBA certifications and B2T Training certifications. You can find a lot of different certification programs, and the money and time you spend on them varies widely. For example, some certificate programs offered by training providers test your knowledge; the cost of earning the certificate is typically included in the cost of taking the courses. Here’s what these programs often entail: You need to take a certain number of courses designated by the training provider. You may have to pass an exam after each course. You get your certificate after completing the courses and passing necessary exams. Some certification programs involve a little more effort from the student, including prerequisites such as the following: You have to have had a certain amount of work experience, complete with references. You have to have had some formal BA training. Other training providers have programs that both test your knowledge and incorporate a competency portion where you must show you can perform the work. These programs have a combination of tests and demonstration. Evaluate certification programs and select the appropriate option based on your corporate and personal professional goals.",

        "text": "Chapter 2 Breaking Down the Different Levels of Business Analysis In This Chapter Identifying the different levels of analysis work Comparing and contrasting analysis efforts at each level Identifying the key people and critical challenges at each level of analysis E ssentially, you perform business analysis at four main levels within a company: the enterprise level, the organizational level, the operational level, and the project level. When taking on most projects as a business analyst (BA), you perform analysis on one level only, although analysis at any level always needs to support the company’s overall goals, mission, and objectives. Most often, multiple projects come together to meet multiple operational goals, which then meet multiple organizational area goals, which in turn meet the big picture strategy of an enterprise. All parts of a company — including your and others’ analysis projects — need to work together to optimize efforts and maximize success. This criteria means that even if you set out to analyze on just one level, you may end up analyzing on any and all levels during your project. As we mention throughout this book, being a BA requires a lot of flexibility and fluidity, beginning with the level at which you work. In this chapter, we detail the characteristics of each level and provide examples of when you may need to perform them. We also point out common challenges and explain how all the levels relate to each other. Checking out an Overview of the Levels Each level of analysis is distinct from but related to the others in a hierarchy that builds from the top down, as you can see in Figure 2-1 . The topmost level — enterprise — contains just one entity, but the bottom level — project — has many entities. The concept makes more sense if you break it down by level, starting at the top: The enterprise level offers the biggest picture of a company. It’s where you do the most strategic work and where the highest-priority and most-visible projects usually reside. The organizational level is the collection of distinct business areas or general regions that make up a company. The operational level features the various tasks — often divided into specific departments or divisions — performed in order to run an organization. The project level is the level at which you execute projects to deliver support or enable the company’s organizational areas and/or operational functions to achieve their objectives. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 2-1: Hierarchy of levels. The levels aren’t always so clearly defined, however. Figure 2-2 shows a structure that’s more like a matrix for a fictional technology company called Computer Central. Before analyzing a potential opportunity or problem within a company such as this one, you must identify how the company levels interact and know where your project exists among them. For example, say Computer Central develops a new piece of hardware for one of its existing market segments to support the enterprise’s strategic objectives of having a larger presence. At an organizational level, the company is concerned with the development and delivery of the new product. At the operational level, it’s concerned with marketing, shipping, and accounting for the product sales. And finally, this hardware initiative results in multiple projects that reside across the various organizational and operational levels (and ultimately, the enterprise level). Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 2-2: Matrix of levels. Going to the Top: The Enterprise Level When we talk about the enterprise level, we don’t mean a deck on the spaceship from Star Trek; we’re referring to the level at which strategic company decisions happen and then trickle down through the company, impacting policies and procedures at all levels. The enterprise level is the collective whole of a company viewed from the highest perspective — such as a parent organization — and contains more than one organizational level. For example, think of a company like Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. It has organizational levels that include news networks such as CNN and entertainment networks such as TNT and Cartoon Network. Even smaller independent companies, such as a law firm or a department of the local or federal government, make decisions on an enterprise level. This level of analysis is often the starting point for a brand-new project and provides context for your requirements analysis and solution development (more on this topic in Chapter 5 ). When you analyze at this level, you can reveal to companies where they have a gap or are operating ineffectively. Enterprise-level analysis also enables you and the company to determine whether the company should go into a new business area or expand an existing area farther (like how Apple grew from just selling computers to offering MP3 players and tablets) and whether the company should purchase or sell to another company (such as when Google purchased YouTube). Performing enterprise analysis involves big-picture thinking to positively and strategically impact the entire company. When doing analysis at this level, you most often work with the senior leaders of the company, such as the chief executive officer (CEO), chief information officer (CIO), chief financial officer (CFO), and chief operating officer (COO). This level of leadership is referred to as the C level. Most organizations have departments that focus primarily on enterprise strategic planning and development that consist of executives and marketing, research, and financial analysts. Depending on the strategic initiative, individuals from other levels, such as organizational or operational, may also be involved. BAs don’t often work at this level until much later in their careers, so your main task until then is to make sure your work on the lower levels always supports this level. Doing business analysis activities at the enterprise level Enterprise-level analysis focuses on optimizing interactions across multiple organizations within a company to benefit the whole. Business analysis activities that take place at this level include the following: Defining the business needs — the rules that govern the company (see Chapters 5 and 8 ) Eliciting goals and competitive product analysis ( Chapter 7 ) Mapping as is (current) state and to be (future) state company processes and process reengineering ( Chapter 13 ) Defining the business case, or the reasons you’re going forward with a project ( Chapter 9 ) Defining solution scope — what the boundaries of your project are ( Chapter 10 ) Determining solution approach, or the way to solve the problem at hand ( Chapter 12 ) Overcoming challenges at the enterprise level Working with senior leaders in any size company comes with challenges. For starters, you typically can get only a limited amount of time with these folks; in large organizations, they may be spread across different offices, which makes getting the group together when necessary extra difficult. For this reason, you need to have clear goals regarding what you want to accomplish in every meeting with senior leaders. You need to be very confident in your techniques and have a plan for how you’ll approach each interaction. Know each leader’s preferred communication style and use it during meetings with them, while providing them with updates, and in presentations related to the initiative. See Chapter 11 for more on creating a stakeholder communication plan. Another obstacle at this level is access. You may need access to market and competitive information or financial information (including salaries) that is typically confidential and not shared openly with everyone in the organization. If you aren’t authorized to receive info you need, you have to get creative. Find someone who does have access and have her provide the answer in a format that doesn’t give detailed confidential information but provides enough to perform your analysis. For example, Kupe worked on a strategic initiative analyzing a core process that spanned multiple business areas of a company. One of the pieces of information he was analyzing was the cost of doing the process. including salary information he didn’t have access to. To get what he needed, Kupe just asked individuals who had access to provide him with a total salary number for groups of individuals across the business areas. Moving to the Organizational Level The organizational level is the level just below enterprise; it refers to the company’s general areas or large regions. Organizational analysis focuses on optimizing the activities and processes within these individual organizational silos as opposed to the interactions between them (which is the domain of enterprise-level analysis). Depending on the organization’s size, a separate strategic group may work to define goals and prioritize projects within the organization. As a BA, you need to spend some time with this group to understand the goals and priorities within the organization and properly plan your projects. The people you interact with at this level of analysis are one layer below executive leaders — most likely directors or VPs of the different business areas. Their main focus is on their specific domains. Think about the division of Microsoft responsible for the Xbox. The leaders of that business area (or organization) probably don’t put much thought into how the sales of Microsoft Office are going; their concerns relate only to Xbox. When you’re doing analysis at the organizational level, understanding the enterprise-level goals helps you prioritize and plan efforts at the organizational level. Say one organization within a company brings you on to develop and roll out a new piece of hardware, but you discover that the enterprise has placed a higher priority on rolling out a different product for a different market segment. In this case, the organization may not want to fund the project or support its development after all, given the priorities on the enterprise level. Even if the enterprise approves the project to begin with, the project may be stalled during the development. Fulfilling duties at the organizational level The activities you perform on this level are generally the same as at the enterprise level, but the scope and specific problems you solve are different. You can imagine the organization areas as enterprises of their own that roll up to the parent enterprise. For example, say a company has a strategic plan at the enterprise level to broaden its market reach by increasing the number of computers it sells. The company has three organizations: one that sells computers, another that sells computer accessories (such as keyboards and monitors), and a third that sells software products. On the organizational analysis level, you work with each separate organization to develop a strategic plan specific to each area. Those plans then fit together into the broader picture to meet the ultimate goal of selling more computers. For each organization, the business analysis tasks you do include the following: Conducting strategic plan development for the organization (flip to Chapter 9 ) Facilitating strategic goal setting sessions and performing competitive product analysis specific to an organization, using competitive analysis as an elicitation technique ( Chapter 7 ) Defining success metrics for the organization and aligning them with the strategic direction of the enterprise ( Chapter 9 ) Understanding how workflow is used to implement changes in process reengineering ( Chapter 15 ) Replicating enterprise analysis activities, including •\tDefining business need ( Chapter 9 ) •\tAssessing capability gaps ( Chapter 9 ) •\tProcess mapping the current and future states, using workflow as a tool to identify and define your processes ( Chapter 13 ) In the end, these efforts need to tie back into the goals and strategy of the larger enterprise. Dealing with organizational-level obstacles The big challenge you encounter when performing organizational analysis is that the leaders of each organizational unit may not care about integration points among other organizational units throughout the company. These leaders own and control their domains and are responsible for the success or failure of their specific areas. You may identify gaps and overlaps among the organizations, but each individual organization may decide those gaps aren’t its problem, especially if it’s currently working efficiently and successfully as a stand-alone entity. We aren’t saying that the organization leaders don’t care about the enterprise’s goals and needs; the leaders are rewarded and judged based on how their organizations perform, so that’s where their focus is. If an effort takes a leader’s time away from her organization and she doesn’t know how it will help her particular area, she’ll be less inclined to play along. You can mitigate this situation by always reminding each organization leader how the project will positively impact her personal area. Demonstrate the project’s relevance and importance as it relates specifically to each leader’s domain, and your work will be infinitely easier. Also, if an organizational-level project makes changes to processes or systems that impact another organizational or operational level, it can cause conflicts and expand the scope of analysis necessary for the project. Although the project may result in resolving a problem for one organization silo, it may actually cause a problem for another silo. As a business analysis professional, you’re responsible for highlighting the potential conflicts and identifying how the scope will increase so the leaders of the organization can make an informed decision on how to move forward. They may decide not to expand scope because doing so may result in problems for another organization. That outcome is okay; you did your due diligence and explained the consequences to the leaders so they could make the decision they needed to. Drilling Down to the Operational Level The operational level is another step down in the hierarchy, so now you’re getting into more specific areas here, such as departments within the company’s regions or divisions. In an entertainment company, for example, you find the programming division (which leads the effort to purchase, create, and schedule programming) and the network operations division that gets the shows on the air. Most organizations that have large initiatives resulting in multiple projects set up program managers or departments to manage the entire rollout of the initiative. At this level, you work with individual department heads or line managers, such as the sales director or the head of marketing. These folks are responsible for a specific process or multiple processes within an organization. Knowing your tasks at the operational level At this level, you should focus your business analysis efforts on developing a program (a group of projects that allow the operational area to achieve the goal of the organizational or enterprise level initiative). For example, to roll out a new hardware product to a market segment, you’d launch several projects, including developing a marketing campaign, updating systems that support the purchase of and payments for the product, and incorporating new processes for product delivery and maintenance. Some of the BA’s activities on this level are similar to those for the enterprise and organizational levels we discuss earlier in the chapter, in that leaders at this level are concerned with the goals and strategy for their departments. However, more-detailed analysis activities take place here: New project or product business case development or project proposals (see Chapter 9 ) Feasibility studies — understanding whether the organization can really accomplish an objective with a particular solution ( Chapter 8 ) Process modeling across operations area — diagramming with workflows ( Chapter 13 ) Product definition — using elicitation to uncover the requirements making up the product (Chapters 6 and 7 ) Project vision definition — identifying the direction for the project and putting boundaries around the solution ( Chapter 10 ) Creating and managing project metrics/measurements — creating an effective plan ( Chapter 11 ) Note: At this stage, while you are working on a document that will be involved in a project, you are at the operational level. The documents you work on will turn into projects (probably), but you get involved with them at this point. Transition requirement development — moving from planning into implementing and understanding all that implementation entails ( Chapter 15 ) Taking on operational-level challenges Operational leaders tend to look only at their own areas and at being more efficient and more effective to help reach the organizational goals. The operation managers may have a sole focus on their departments, but they also need to understand how they fit into the organizational goals, which fit into the enterprise goals. This risk extends beyond the higher-ups as well. At the operational level, company employees are responsible for supporting the ongoing operational needs of the business and have very little time to work on new initiatives or provide innovative ideas for improvement. They need to do things like sell advertising, program shows, and keep the business running. This load alone isn’t an easy task at any company, so asking them to stop and think about where they can improve or add another product to the mix adds stress for them. However, after a company identifies and launches an initiative (like your project), you must engage these individuals in refining the current processes. Eventually, these employees will be responsible for supporting the new processes, so their participation now is key. Learning as much as possible about the enterprise and organizational goals and strategy helps you as a business analysis professional to guide and advise the operation leaders. Use this knowledge to support the operation leaders’ improvement. If you know their business well, you can help drive the initiative forward while allowing the employees to stay engaged with both the project and their regular operational responsibilities. You can accomplish this balancing act by spending time observing the work done in the operations area and asking questions of the people who work in the business. A great time for this interaction is over lunch with employees, where you can get to know them better, find out more about their business, and understand what drives them. If you follow this strategy with your operational leaders, you can better represent them on projects. And as for observation, just ask to sit and watch how someone does her job. People love showing what they do and how they do it! Getting a Handle on the Project Level The project level is the lowest level of analysis and is where most of the business analysis work at companies happens (because each enterprise has a handful of organizations, many operational areas for each organization, and many projects per operation area); Figure 2-1 earlier in the chapter shows you a graphical breakdown of this alignment. Therefore, the business analysis profession is highly focused on the project area. The people you deal with on a regular basis at this level include your solution team members, your project managers, development staff (if you’re on a software development project), and quality assurance analysts. On the business side, you work with subject matter experts and users of the solution. Understanding the people you work with on the project is important, so in Chapters 3 and 11 , we provide more information for conducting stakeholder analysis. Tackling activities at the project level A project delivers a solution that’s meant to enable the operation area to achieve its goals. For example, if a computer company wants to sell more laptop computers and has made a decision to start selling them directly to consumers rather than through retail stores, it needs to initiate a number of projects in order to implement the new goal, such as creating a website where customers can search for items, order products, and track their orders. Because this level is where BAs do most of their work, the rest of the book focuses on this level of analysis in great detail. For now, you should know that although your team can take different project approaches to deliver your project or solution (as we discuss in Chapter 11 ), the activities you perform at this level remain the same: Planning your analysis work for the project (see Chapter 11 ) Scoping the project — understanding a business case, creating and maintaining the requirements scope for a project (Chapters 9 and 10 ) Eliciting and analyzing the business problem or opportunity and understanding the true business need (Chapters 5 through 8) Eliciting, analyzing, and communicating the solution requirements (Chapters 12 and 13 ) Verifying that the solution you’re building addresses the need and helps the business reach its goals ( Chapter 14 ) Developing transition requirements — moving from planning into implementing and understanding all that implementation entails ( Chapter 15 ) At first read of the preceding bullets, you may think that this book’s organization doesn’t match up to the project activity chronology. But there’s a method to our madness. Even though planning is the first thing you do on a project, it requires a certain amount of foundational understanding. As BA trainers, we actually teach our planning class late in our curriculum because our students need to know all the techniques available before they can plan. Rising above project-level hurdles Much like at the operational level, getting time from the key project-level people you need is difficult. These folks are doing the work day in and day out. They’re paid to work for the business, not to work on your project. Although helping improve the current state of the business is part of their jobs, getting the time you need out of them is tough if they’re behind on their day-to-day work. To overcome this challenge, concentrate on collaborating with your peers and building good relationships with your teammates. Find out everyone’s strengths and determine as a team how to work well together. Remind folks (including yourself) that on projects, everyone is part of a larger team. Head to Chapter 11 for more on getting stakeholders involved. You need to be aware of how your project fits into the bigger picture of the business. As a business analyst, you’re in the perfect spot to see when a project is no longer aligned with the higher goals of the enterprise. Don’t lose the forest for the trees. Build spots into your project where you do a sanity check — that is, you make sure the project is still aligned with operational, organizational, and enterprise goals. These goals can change during the life of the project, so if you don’t periodically stop and check, you can drive yourself (and everyone else) crazy when you realize later that you’ve just completed a project that no longer adds any value to the company!",

        "text": "Chapter 3 Identifying and Working with Stakeholders In This Chapter Understanding who participates in projects Knowing the people in your neighborhood: your stakeholders Figuring out how best to work with various stakeholders Striving toward effective communication S takeholder is a generic term for a person or a group of people who have an interest in an initiative and will be affected by it (directly or indirectly) or have influence over it. In other words, your stakeholders may not necessarily be a part of your project team, so you may have to think outside the box when identifying them. Consider a project to create a new application to support order fulfillment. Obviously, the order fulfillment, warehouse, and distribution departments are stakeholders, but how about the internal technical support desk? They aren’t part of the project team, but they’ll be impacted by the initiative because they’ll field technical support questions when the system rolls out. This role makes the people in this group stakeholders. In this chapter, we discuss working with different stakeholders as you perform business analysis. Some of them are internal to the company, while others are external. These people have many unique titles, but what they have in common is that they’re all relevant to the project in one way or another. We explain how to understand who these people are, how to figure out their degree of involvement in the project, and how to best work with them. Reviewing a Who’s Who of Potential Project Participants Many roles are required to complete a project successfully: management roles (for providing information) and other roles (for creating and delivering the right solution). Note: Even though we use common job titles to categorize the different roles, don’t get hung up on the titles. It’s more important that you recognize what roles are needed for what purpose. The titles used in your company may be different. Starting at the top with management The people on the management side hold titles such as executive sponsor, account manager, product manager, and project manager. These people manage the project and business areas and are generally the highest-ranking member of the project. Executive sponsor The executive sponsor is the raison d’etre of the project or initiative — the person who initiates the project, has a vision of what the end product should be, and comes up with the project to accomplish it. The project may be integrating a commercial off-the-shelf ( COTS ) tool or improving the efficiency of a claims process. The executive sponsor also provides the funding for the project (after all, he’s the one who wants it done, so he has to pony up the money). An executive sponsor Approves project scope and signs-off on requirements Is most interested in high-level information and how it relates to the funding of the project Generally isn’t concerned with the detailed, day-to-day operations and minutiae of the project If a stalemate regarding the project’s direction ever occurs, the buck really does stop at the executive sponsor. Why? Simple: He’s the one paying for the project. Account manager/product manager The account (or product ) manager may hold a higher-level manager title, but this person defines the overall requirements and marketing approach for the product. Account/product managers are representatives of the external customer; they’re the intermediaries between the external customer and the business, finding out what the customer wants and creating product requirements based on that information. The account or product manager Makes decisions regarding project direction Reviews project requirements and may also review overall project requirements with the executive sponsor and guide/advise him on sign-off Generally has decision-making authority Is more involved with the project than the executive sponsor Note: Don’t get caught up in the exact title of the person performing this role. Someone with the title of project manager or some other title may play this role. Project manager The project manager (PM) is responsible for managing the project, including the project plan, the project scope and deliverables, and the work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS is the detailed task list outlining who is responsible for each task, the amount of time to complete, and the dependencies each task has on another. During project execution, the PM ensures the project scope continues to align with the project objectives, and he raises any concerns with the adjusted project plan, including any missed dates or expired deadlines. As the project moves forward and new opportunities or product features are discussed, the PM ensures that changes in scope are relevant to the scope and align with the project goal. The PM will probably look to you for help with understanding the impact that a scope change has to the project; he then reports those scope changes in terms of the project impact to the executive sponsor. A project manager Identifies and staffs the appropriate project team members Creates the project plan for the overall project and seeks input on the requirements plan from the business analyst Reports on status for the entire project Manages the project risk plan and executes risk responses if a risk is realized Addresses and overcomes project barriers affecting completion of the project Looks to the BA for updates on the progress of the requirements phase Manages the project change control process, working with the BA to address project impact during change control Sometimes, you may find yourself playing the dual-role of BA/PM, which can be a challenge because of the natural conflict between roles. The BA function focuses on analyzing items of the project; the PM function focuses on meeting the project dates. If you tend to like one role more than the other, be careful not to concentrate on one at the expense of the other. Seeking subject matter experts Subject matter experts (SMEs) are —surprise! — experts in the particular business or solution area you are working in for your project. These are the people you interview in order to craft your business requirements. You work with two kinds of subject matter experts: domain experts and implementation experts . Domain subject matter experts Domain SMEs are the people who provide project objectives, potential problems, and risks from the business perspective. They’re businesspeople, and their job is understanding the business. To get to the right domain SME for your project, make sure you understand the subject matter expertise and who can best explain it. For instance, if you’re looking for information about a flight management system, you probably want to talk to a pilot, but if you’re interested in the maintenance of that system, you want to talk to an aircraft mechanic. In any domain, make sure you’re asking the person who actually performs the job. Other people may have an idea about how it’s done, but the best person to ask is the person who performs the process. Domain SMEs also set the priority of the project objectives and the requirements based on what they need to accomplish from the business perspective. You may help them prioritize by giving them guidance on impacts and analysis, but ultimately, they own the business area and the prioritization. Understand that addressing the most critical business requirements (business needs) is the value attached to the prioritization on the requirements, so it’s very important to understand the difference between the business requirement and a solution. A domain SME Provides information about the business and specific business terms Provides detailed requirements related to business processes and data Offers suggestions as to potential solutions to the business problem or opportunity related to the project Assists in defining project scope Works with the BA on user interfaces, business processes, data, and business rule definition Reviews detailed requirements documents, user interfaces, business process diagrams, and other deliverables to validate that the project and solution is right for the business Because domain subject matter experts typically work within the problem area for a long time, they often figure out work-arounds and solutions to their problems and want you to use them as the project solution. Don’t take their word for it, though; forge ahead with your process. You may find that the SMEs’ solutions are viable in the end, but you must give them a fair analysis. Implementation subject matter expert The implementation SME is the one who provides technical expertise on how to develop a solution to solve the business’s problem. In a software environment, you’re talking about someone like the developer, lead developer, or software architect. In a warehousing business area, it may be a logistics expert or warehousing engineer. Implementation SMEs provide possible solutions to solve the business problem and can respond and provide guidance about other possible solutions. For example, if a solution or screen design may not be possible with the current limitations of tools, the implementation SME will work to guide the solution team down a path to create a feasible solution. Generally, the majority of the resources come into the project at the phase when you’re creating some sort of project solution. An implementation SME Guides the project team on possible solutions to the business problem Works with the BA to create user interfaces and makes sure the interface supports the real work of the business Ensures that the suggested solutions are feasible from an implementation perspective and provides guidance on the impact of alternate approaches Adding project support personnel Project support personnel are those who support the project in various ways as it moves along. They’re usually not assigned as 100 percent full-time resources on any one project; rather, they function as specialists supporting multiple projects within an organization. They allocate their time based on the project priority within the organization. Think of these people as advisors or consultants. For instance, unless you’re building an application to support the legal department, you probably don’t need to understand the legal department’s business processes. But a few members of that department may be stakeholders within your project. They may give you guidelines about how long to store customer data or what types of customer data you’re allowed to store. You may have to run a solution the group comes up with by legal to get it approved. Of course, legal isn’t the only department that falls into this category. If you’re designing user interfaces for external customers, you may need a usability engineer or information architect. You can understand where the project support people are within the organization, to what extent you need their advice, and how much time they have to support your project by looking at the organizational chart or by asking other stakeholders and even BAs who are in other areas of the business. Project support personnel May be involved in providing the group with constraints for the solution, based on what the team is designing Are assigned to your project and act in a consulting capacity Are experts in the subject matter they’re working within and are brought into your project as a project support person (PSP) Guide the project team within their particular advisory subject matter area Organization change management professional The organization change management professional facilitates acceptance of solutions, creates the change management plans, and advocates the need for the change. Usually, you find organization change management professionals assigned to big, highly strategic, company-wide projects such as switching 4,500 account executives to a new sales system. As a BA, do you find you do these things? You probably answered yes, and you’re right: On many projects, this role usually falls to the BA rather than to a separate resource. See more on this in Chapter 15 . Regulators Regulators are the people and organizations creating guidelines and possibly constraints on your project and solution. Think of them as the legal department within your organization; they specify what you can and can’t do with your project. You may be implementing a solution to ensure that your organization adheres to industry or government regulations. Additionally, they may guide how you have to produce some of your deliverables. In the case of the armed forces, for example, certain documentation must conform to U.S. defense standards in order to be accepted by the customer. Similarly, communications companies must adhere to guidelines imposed by the Federal Communications Committee (FCC). The regulators also impose audit standards around the project. Technical writer The technical writer writes the software manuals, online help and web page help text, and user training manuals. The tech writer understands both how the solution functions and the audience who will be reading the produced tech manuals. Technical writers are mainly concerned with requirements such as the workflows (or process maps/diagrams) and the external agents or actors (the people who will be using the system). Although they deal with technical “stuff,” they support the project only when necessary. Turning to technical personnel The technical personnel are those resources (the corporate way of saying people ) on a project who help address how technology supports and fulfills the business requirements. If the solution for your project is a technical one, they build the solution. The earlier they are involved in the project, the better. They can provide guidance if the suggested solution isn’t technologically feasible. Some of the duties technical personnel perform include designing the solution and system security, system architecture, and network architecture. They also create the interfaces with other computer systems and databases. Technical personnel also assist the testing effort by unit testing the programs and modules they write as part of the proposed project solution. They make sure the modules work well independently prior to integration testing. They may also help with integration testing. Technical personnel Are interested in how the software needs to support the business need. Need to understand the business and solution requirements so they can code a solution that matches what the business needs. Interact with the BA to fully understand the needs of the business. Work best with others who have some technical knowledge. You don’t have to be able to speak in computer programming language, but you do need to know the basics that are relevant to your project. Make sure the technical personnel’s efforts support the original business requirements and functional design. You don’t want the technical personnel to develop a solution that does not address the business need. A programmer who states, “I know what the business needs better than the business does,” isn’t the kind of programmer you want on the project. He’ll program what he thinks the business wants even though the business states something completely different. The best way to overcome this issue is to bring the programmers in during the design phase or earlier. Then they can offer suggestions and make the user interface work within the boundaries of the system. When they’re involved early, they have a stake in the solution (because they helped design it) and will be hesitant to change it unnecessarily during the course of the implementation. Usability engineer Usability engineers primarily design user interfaces. People in this position have experience with how humans interact with machines, and they bring insight to the field of man–machine interface. If you’re working on a customer-facing application (an application used by public consumers versus internally or on the backend), you’re probably more likely to have one of these people on your project. Think of Apple. Many people think Apple’s products are easier to use than a competitor’s product, and that’s because Apple has people that understand how users interface with a product and address that need to make it easier. Usability engineers also assess usability for user interfaces they didn’t necessarily design and may assist with testing for defects that may inhibit usability of the solution. Quality assurance personnel Quality assurance (QA) personnel are responsible for assuring the team delivers a quality product. On a project, their first initiative is to review the project requirements and write test plans. These people are a very big help for the BA, so you want to befriend them early on in the project. They look at every requirement to make sure they can test it and verify it. If they can’t verify it, then the requirement is not clear enough. This will mean the technical team won’t have clarity on how the solution should address that requirement. By looking at your requirements early on, they can filter out ambiguous statements such as “The software should be easy to use.” QA folks are also responsible for setting up the test environments, writing test cases, executing and overseeing testing activities, and reporting and following up on defects. Database administrator The database administrator (DBA), sometimes called a data administrator , looks at data from an enterprise-wide perspective. The project you work on will most likely use data. Instead of creating a brand-new database, the DBA looks to see where data already exists within the organization and whether it can be reused for the project. He also provides data-naming standards and conventions. As a BA, you may consult with the DBA on logical data modeling techniques. Your job isn’t to design a database, but you should work on the logical relationships from a business perspective. The DBA can help with that from his data knowledgebase. A DBA generally wants to help because he’s ultimately responsible for designing the physical database. Identifying the Stakeholders in Your Project The project participants also have project-related roles and duties that are separate (although related) from their professional responsibilities (which we lay out in the earlier section Reviewing a Who’s Who of Potential Project Participants ). Just like actors in a play, stakeholders have roles in the project. Someone may have the title of Retail Sales Person Level 1, but they’re the SME for the retail sales project, which ends up being their role in the project. You use two main steps in identifying your cast of stakeholders: a stakeholder list and an RACI matrix. Find your stakeholders The first thing to do is look for all the stakeholders (anyone who impacts or is impacted) on the project. A stakeholder is a group or person who has interests that may be affected by an initiative or has influence over it. Stakeholders can be found anywhere for a project. If you identify a group or department, make sure you identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholder group. Someone has to be the point person. Here’s how to create a stakeholder list: 1.\tAnalyze the project documentation. Look for people, groups, departments, customers, and project team members affected by the project. (For info on how to successfully analyze documentation, visit Chapter 7 ). Note: Go directly to Step 2 if no documentation is available. 2.\tPull project team members together to brainstorm about other affected parties that aren’t included in the documentation. 3.\tMake a stakeholder list. Your list should include the stakeholder, whether he has sign-off authority, and how he’s affected by the project (his stake ). You may also want to include a “Notes” column in your stakeholder list to keep track of effective ways of communicating with the stakeholder or other reminders (see Figure 3-1 for an example of how to lay it out). Just be careful about what you write and with whom you share the notes; you don’t want your personal notes to be taken the wrong way or end up in the wrong hands. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 3-1: A stakeholder list is a good way to keep important details organized. Using the RACI matrix Another tool you can use is an RACI matrix. RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. It’s basically a chart that shows the different responsibilities people hold on your project. By thinking through the chart and presenting it to the project team as an official deliverable, you can help everyone understand who’s doing what on the project. You and the stakeholders should create the matrix together to ensure that it’s accurate and that everyone is on the same page. Here’s how to assemble an RACI matrix (check out Figure 3-2 to see an example): 1.\tList all the actions or responsibilities needed for the project along the left side of the page. 2.\tList all the stakeholders for the project along the top of the page. 3.\tFill in each box with R, A, C, or I to describe the person’s level of responsibility. Each letter corresponds to a level of responsibility: •\tResponsible: The actual person performing the work. For instance, in the case of the requirements package, the BA is generally responsible for the work. For the technical documentation, it’s usually the implementation SME. •\tAccountable: The one ultimately answerable for the correct completion of the deliverable or task and who delegates the work to the responsible party. This person also approves (signs off on) the deliverable or task. You can specify only one accountable for each task or deliverable. •\tConsulted: Those whose opinions are sought, typically SMEs, and with whom you have two-way communication. Your project support personnel are typically consulted parties. •\tInformed: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress. This communication is usually one-way — for example, the BA informs the external stakeholders that the requirements phase is complete. 4.\tDistribute the matrix to all stakeholders . This dissemination keeps everyone on track and informed. Roles aren’t 100 percent exclusive. Remember, these roles are just parts in the overall project play. Just like some actors play multiple roles in films (Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies comes to mind), stakeholders on a project may wear multiple hats and play different roles. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 3-2: Create and distribute an RACI matrix to keep all stakeholders on track. Playing (and Communicating) Well with Others As the BA, you need to be able to figure out the best way to communicate with each team member. Your communication and interaction styles with each team member vary based on your relationship. The tips and communication styles we discuss later in this section are just a starting point. Treat each team member as an individual, do what you can to get to know him well, and communicate with him accordingly; it goes a long way in making your BA work successful. For example, if you develop a really good relationship with an executive, your communication style is going to be a lot more intimate (and, therefore, probably more fruitful) than with a team member you don’t know as well. Because communication is at the heart of everything a BA does, spending time honing your communication skills is important. Even the most experienced business analysis professional can find something in this section to improve about the way he shares information. Targeting your communication to the various stakeholders A message is only as good as how it’s received. Take the time now to get familiar with the ins and outs of different stakeholders; it pays off in dividends down the line. Working with executive sponsors On a project, the executive sponsor is the your most important stakeholder. He controls the funding for the project, has expectations about what the project will deliver, and will decide if the project is successful or not. Following are some good questions to think about asking the sponsor to find out what the sponsor needs or expects from the project and the project outcome. Knowing the answers to these questions definitely contributes to project success: Does the executive sponsor have a clear vision of the desired state? Does he or she understand what it will take to get there? Is he or she expecting measurable results? And if so, what are the metrics? Will he or she encourage people to express concerns? Has he or she considered aligning rewards to support the change? Has he or she defined success as a business outcome as opposed to a systems implementation? What is he or she expecting after the project is complete? How often does he or she plan to interact with the project team? You may not work directly with your sponsor. If that is the case, you’ll work closely with other management and need to gain this information from them. Dealing with domain SMEs The first thing to understand about domain SMEs is that they’re there to do the business of the business. If they sometimes seem to give you short answers or want to just get to the solution quickly, it’s because they want to get back to doing the business. So how can you best work with them? Keep your interactions with them short and to the point. Look to Chapter 6 for detailed ways to get information from them and notes on which techniques work best based on the size of the group. Put yourself in their position and learn their business area. The best strategy isn’t to walk in and ask SMEs for their requirements; rather, it’s to ask them about their business problems. Because they know the subject so well, they’re highly likely to give you solutions. When you approach them, establish a rapport. You can briefly talk about the project to set the stage for the discussion topic, but very quickly go into having them explain what they do in their business area related to the project scope. Keep it in their world. Don’t stray off onto other topics, even if they’re project-related. You aren’t solving your project; you’re solving their business problem. Proactively notify them about the project and what it’s all about. They’ll want to tell you all about their experience with the process and probably will give you many ways to fix it. Keep it simple. Use the business area’s language rather than project-oriented BA language. Conferring with project support personnel Because project support personnel are not fulltime members of the team, you need to be as efficient as possible with their time. Here are a few tips on how to do that: Proactively point out what you need from them. Don’t make them search through loads of documentation to find what is relevant to them. Make it short and sweet. Project support personnel are most interested in how your project interacts with their particular area of support. Don’t over-explain all aspects of the project; focus on how it impacts them. Just like the technical team, don’t commit project support people’s time or involvement with a project before understanding their time constraints. Asking other parties for information helps establish your credibility as a liaison. Talking to technical personnel Although your primary job as a BA is to understand the intricacies of the business, you need to have some technical knowledge so that you can communicate effectively with the tech folks. Here are the situations in which this knowledge can help you: When you have to understand their explanations so you can offer dialogue on the solutions. When you need to validate the solution team’s understanding. If a given time estimate seems way off or they say the requirements can’t be met, you need to have enough knowledge to recognize that fact and to question their assumptions. In questioning their assumptions, we mean having a good debate so the team comes up with the best solution for the business need. Don’t commit the team to providing a particular solution without consulting the team first. If you want the team to be committed to delivering a solution, the team members need to be part of the process that came up with it. The same concept applies to the quality assurance team as well. You don’t need to be an expert in quality assurance, but the more familiar you are with the processes followed and the techniques used, the more relevant your conversations with them will be. Using active listening to your advantage No matter which stakeholder or project team member you’re working with, you need to understand active listening in order to be a great communicator. Communicating is vital to a BA’s success, but sometimes people forget that listening is just as important as — or maybe more important than — talking (or texting, e-mailing, or even writing this book). Active listening refers to the level of engagement you have with your communication partner. It involves not only listening but also performing actions that assure your partner that you’re truly engaged in listening. Here are some great active listening tips: Listen to the speaker’s entire message. In today’s time-is-money environment, you may be tempted to interrupt the speaker because you “know” what he’s going to say. But if you don’t hear the entire thought, you may miss something important. Ask questions to understand what the other person says. Open-ended questions are great for eliciting, but when you need to actively listen and confirm, you should ask a closed question that requires only a yes or no answer. Paraphrase to confirm what you heard. When you paraphrase, use phrases such as “So to let me understand what you’re saying . . . .” or “If I heard you correctly . . . .” Overcoming common barriers to effective communications We live in a time when so many barriers — some of which even seem to be socially acceptable — hinder communication. The more you understand how these obstacles can get in the way, the more you’re prepared to overcome them and be a great communicator. You can find many great communication tips to overcome barriers and exhaustive books on communication topics (check out Communicating Effectively For Dummies by Marty Brounstein [Wiley]), but we list some of the most common suggestions here: Try to minimize outside distractions so you can focus on your stakeholder completely. Mobile phones and their land-line brethren, for example, are great communication tools, but when the phone goes off, let it ring. Better yet, turn it to silent or off completely when you’re with stakeholders. If you’re expecting an important call, notify the person who comes in and sits down that if that call comes through, you’ll have to take it. Be aware of and address culture and language differences directly. As a BA, you work with different people all the time, so it’s practically a given that you’ll work with people who have different cultures — maybe even languages — from you. And culture and language aren’t just about nationality; they can also be about the company itself. When you join a new project, take time upfront to observe how people speak, carry themselves, and interact. Share a bit about your communication style, too. Doing so sets the foundation for open dialogue later down the road if a misunderstanding occurs over words. Note any special needs and be sure to check in throughout the project to make sure your stakeholders understand you and that you understand them. For example, perhaps a stakeholder is hard of hearing. To prevent that person from missing out on important information, maybe you always come to meetings with pretyped notes or an agenda so everyone can follow along. Don’t let your past experiences determine your future. Just because the previous project data administrator was a real jerk doesn’t mean the next one will be — or vice versa. Each person has his or her own unique personality. Consciously remind yourself to not let prior experiences with others get in the way of your current relationship. Keep meetings from running too long. Do you how long a meeting can be before people check out and start doing something else? Two hours? One hour? Each company’s individual culture dictates the actual number, but from experience, we can tell you that 1 to 1.5 hours is generally about the maximum period people can stay focused without drifting off to e-mail and other tasks. That number is even less if the meeting is a teleconference. If you have to conduct meetings longer than 1 hour, work in a 10-minute break every hour. One final pointer to facilitate effective communication: Always ask the stakeholders how best to communicate with them; don’t automatically assume you know their preferences. Understanding and responding to verbal and nonverbal messages Most people believe that words are the communication of the message when, in fact, words make up only 7 percent of the message. Tone of voice and nonverbal communication make up the other 93 percent. As a BA, you should be familiar with the positives and pitfalls of common verbal and nonverbal communication, such as the following: Be precise, direct, and accurate in your communications. Don’t be vague or confusing. If a message is unclear, the receiver interprets it negatively 90 percent of the time. Consider your reaction when your boss leaves you a voicemail at 4:30 on Friday telling you he wants to see you Monday morning. Chances are you go through the entire weekend trying to determine what you did wrong, and then when Monday comes around, he tells you a stakeholder passed along an “atta-boy” that he wanted to communicate to you. So you were worried all weekend for nothing. That’s what happens when communication is unclear. Be aware of distracting nonverbal communications. Unnecessary movements, words, and even sounds take attention away from you and decrease the effectiveness of your communication. Think about how you present. Do you stand there comfortably and calmly or do you rock back and forth, look at your watch, and rattle change in your pocket? Know your habits and then seek to remove them as a barrier to the communication process. You may even need to enlist the help of a video camera so you can see yourself presenting, or have a friend to give you feedback. After all, you don’t want people to remember you for the number of times you looked at your watch rather than for the actual content of your presentation. Make sure you spell-check everything. The effect of misspellings or typos may be more powerful than you realize. To you, it may just be a misspelled word, but if it’s in a slideshow presentation, you may have just lost your audience. Don’t believe it? If you’ve ever seen a misspelled word in a presentation, what did you do for the remainder of the meeting? You look for misspelled words. Yup. That presenter lost his audience. Instead of rereading your own communication, have an independent person read it. That person doesn’t know what it’s supposed to say, so he’s more likely to catch mistakes you missed. Just as you need to be aware of the nonverbal messages you send, you also need to take note of the nonverbal messages you’re receiving. If you notice a disconnect between what the stakeholder says and the message he’s sending nonverbally, take some time to figure out where the disconnect is. Say, for example, that he’s telling you he’s very open to your suggestions, but his folded arms and curt tone imply otherwise. You can take a moment to check in with him after the meeting, after everyone else is gone, or maybe send an e-mail later. Maybe he actually isn’t okay with the changes, and your check-in gives him a chance to express that. Alternatively, you may find out that his nonverbals had nothing to do with the meeting but rather with a personal matter. Either way, following up and clarifying anything that doesn’t match up is always a good idea. Fostering Strong Relationships How do you build strong relationships with your stakeholders? Be an excellent communicator. Consistently look for ways to improve the communication process and keep checking in with stakeholders to see whether you’re hitting the mark. Head to the earlier section Playing (and Communicating) Well with Others for details on communication skills and read on for information on strengthening relationships. Building trust and respect When taking on large projects, stakeholders are often tasked with double duty for their current daily job as well as this new project. For that reason, building rapport with stakeholders is crucial. Show them that they are appreciated and respected. Here are some ways to foster trust and respect among stakeholders: Make the best use of people’s time. Don’t call them into meetings that they don’t need to attend. By understanding and respecting their involvement, you become a more trusted advisor. Refrain from speaking negatively about team members. Even if you know inside information about a team member, keep it to yourself. And if someone wants to gossip with you about someone else, don’t engage. Don’t break trust if information is given to you in confidence. This point is especially important if the knowledge in question is something you need to know but other people can’t, such as a consultant rolloff plan (the plan that’s in place to reduce the number of consultants as the project nears its end). Don’t assign them timeframes in which to complete tasks; ask them for estimates. In this way, you don’t overcommit the stakeholders or the technical team. When assigning action items or tasks, ask the person who will actually be doing the task how long it will take. By having him give you the estimate himself, you avoid overcommitting him. And having him give you a time makes him more likely to stick to that time than he would be if you assigned one. To build rapport, find a common bond between both of you. What do they display on their walls — golf pictures? If you like golf, too, you have your “in.” You can also “feel their pain”: See whether you can sit beside them as they do their job (or even perform the task yourself) so you can experience the business “pain” firsthand. The more you learn about each side (business and technical), the more you have a sense of whether an estimate by either side is way out of line. When that happens, you’re in a better position to speak from confidence and question it, and the stakeholders are less likely to be offended by your challenge because it’s based on your genuine understanding of their side. Generating consensus/gaining buy-in One of your responsibilities is to help keep the project moving forward. Times will occur when stakeholders do not agree on requirements. Getting everyone on board to support the scope and requirements for a solution can be difficult, but it’s possible. Although not all team members may get their preference right out of the gate, they’ll be able to support it. Consensus is tough; to be successful, you have to understand the motivations for each stakeholder and what’s really important to them. To gain buy-in, let the stakeholders share their ideas. People who’ve had the chance to speak their minds are more likely to buy in to a decision even when they’re not totally convinced that solution is the best. Even when one ultimate decision maker exists (which is often the case), you can’t just go to that stakeholder to get the scope of the project and all the requirements and move on. Others are impacted, and they can easily sabotage or slow down the process if they don’t buy in. Not getting buy-in is a cause for scope creep. Imagine a director making a decision about project scope without including his management team in the decision process. Chances are one manager (or many managers) won’t agree with that decision and try to slip their scope items throughout the project. You need to recognize when people haven’t bought in to a decision. You may need to step back and gain buy-in before moving forward in the project.",

BAs typically use general or specialized tools that fit into five different categories: communication, collaboration, definition, innovation and idea capture, and requirements management. The first two are general tools and support productivity across all business analysis activities, while the last three are specialized and focus more deeply on enabling particular activities and achieving specific analysis goals. In this chapter, we overview the different types of tools out there and help you think about their benefits so you can identify the ones for your business analysis needs. We don't, however, give you the brand names of different tools because technology products and options change at the speed of light. Tools that were big players two years ago have slipped, and others that were hardly a blip last year now are very powerful. Business analysis tools and the vendors that provide them change faster than in any other industry. To find our recommendations, check out the Resources section on our B2T Training website ( www.b2ttraining.com ), where we maintain a current list of tools for reference. You can also do a web search by typing \"software\" + \"workflow modeling\" (or your topic of choice) + \"vendors.\" The list that pops up will be immediately relevant and pretty much guaranteed to include whatever two to three tools we'd choose to highlight at that moment. Productivity tools aren’t a substitute for sound business analysis. Used poorly or for the wrong reasons, tools may create more problems than they solve. Examining Communication Tools for Every Situation Communication tools are the most basic of all the productivity tools. In fact, you probably use most of the common communication tools in the following sections every day, whether you’re performing analysis or not. Talking about your options Several tools facilitate urgent transfer and delivery of messages. These choices are good for situations where you can’t be face-to-face in the moment but still need someone’s real-time attention: Text messaging: Great when you just need to share information quickly or ask an immediate yes/no/opinion question that really can’t wait. Chat or instant messaging: The electronic equivalent of sticking your head into someone’s office. It’s a helpful relationship builder for remote colleagues, but if your question is more than one or two lines long or the chat will take more than two minutes to complete, switch to phone (or e-mail, if the matter requires less-immediate attention). Phone calls: Tone of voice plays a significant role in communicating effectively, so picking up the phone is the best way to go when you can’t meet in person but need to discuss a potentially sensitive topic, convey understanding, or build teams and strengthen relationships. When you need to communicate directly with a specific person but immediate connection isn’t possible or appropriate, try one of the following: Voicemail: Great for getting an important message or question delivered to a specific individual with appropriate tone of voice. Most voice mailboxes are private, but this setup isn’t always the case. When in doubt about privacy, leave a brief, general message that conveys the topic and requests a return call. E-mail: Useful for longer messages, sharing attachments, and tracking communication history. E-mail often gets information and some media transmitted most quickly, but actual communication speed depends on how frequently the recipient checks or receives e-mail and her initiative and interest in writing back. Postal mail (snail mail): Useful in situations where a hard copy is important — like if special paper, binding, or color printing is needed —or you need the recipient to sign and return papers. If documents are long, stakeholders may find reading a physical document more convenient than an electronic one. Some tools are built for group communications, allowing people to correspond at their convenience without an influx of e-mails. Recipients connect when they have time and desire. Be aware that a delay occurs between posting and receiving information, so these tools aren’t ideal for time-sensitive messaging: Message boards: One person posts a message or question, and others respond. Good for discussions on specific, single-topic items, for issue and risk management, and for gathering feedback on specific requirements prior to decision-making. Social networking tools: Corporate/inter-office/private networks similar to message boards. However, they feature multimedia and significantly more interaction. They’re terrific for relationship-building and idea-generation. When you need to share information with large audiences but discussion is less appropriate, these one-way communication tools may be effective: Public broadcast television or radio: Despite being used very infrequently in the business analysis world, these media can be still helpful in getting a message out to public audiences where appropriate. You can recommend using these options to solicit potential focus group members, request volunteers for market research or solution user testing, or to distribute particular marketing messages. Video: Video is useful for getting info out to large audiences while incorporating tone of voice and body language. It’s especially useful during times of managing change because it’s great for building situational understanding, communicating commitment, inspiring solutions and implementation efforts, and ensuring that all audiences get the same message. Webinar or web conference: With or without a video component, these options are great for building understanding, commitment, or action. They’re useful for change efforts, as well as solution demonstrations, requirements walk-throughs, or information previews. They can be tailored to small or large audiences and can include document display and multimedia. Although audience participation is possible in webinars, large audience discussions are difficult to manage without a special producer. In some circumstances, you may need to communicate with people who are  hearing-impaired. Tools such as captioned telephone, teletypewriter (TTY) or telecommunications relay services (TRS) can help. Choosing the right communication tool The communication tool or method you choose should be appropriate for the audience, content, purpose, and message giver of the communication (as a BA, you may create communications for others to deliver). When evaluating communication tools, consider the following: Number of people involved: What works well for 10 people may not work well for 80. Type of info to be shared: Are you sharing verbal or visual information? If it’s visual, do you share text, illustration, photos, or video? Some tools are better suited for visuals than others. Amount or volume of info being communicated: A few paragraphs of information may need 20 minutes and a different communication method than a 40-page document requiring 2 hours. Frequency of exchange: Consider “why,” “how often,” and “for what purpose?” Depending on your need, the solution may be a weekly team meeting, team members communicating project information three times a day, or a sponsor giving quarterly updates to solution users. Desire/need for discussion or response: Your approach may differ if communications need to be two-way/back-and-forth versus one-way outbound, such as for announcements or content broadcast. Sensitivity of the message and expected audience reaction: You may need to take privacy and security into account: • Privacy needs: Sometimes people react unexpectedly when hearing about organizational impacts of solutions, so think about how best to deliver messages so people hear them as intended. Consider whether it makes sense for group members to connect individually (personal reactions held more privately) or as a group (reactions are more public and experienced with the group). Sensitive topics may be best discussed in real-time instead of being sent over e-mail to be read alone and interpreted. Set up individual calls or a conference. For larger groups, use a conference call or video/web conference, followed by an e-mail to emphasize key message points. • Security needs: How sensitive is the message? Implement information protection methods where appropriate. If privacy is required but conversation or conferencing isn’t possible, be sure to use security encryption on e-mail. Also consider document settings that disallow printing or forwarding of materials. If you’re using phone or web conference, disable settings that allow participants to initiate or save recordings of the session. Need for live communication: Phone or conferencing tools are good choices for situations where information and reactions are discussed immediately. If topics need review or thoughtful consideration before discussion, use a delayed or off-line approach. For instance, send information ahead for prereading, but discuss it later in a different communications setting. Interest in recording or reviewing communications later: Sometimes getting everyone you need together at one time is impossible. If you want to ensure everyone hears the same information, consider recording the session and sharing it in an encore performance. Trying Collaboration Tools Collaboration is critical to business analysis success. It’s about working together with other people to accomplish common goals whether you’re all in one location or dispersed across many. To collaborate well, team members must understand the goal and purpose of the collaboration and actively contribute to the efforts by freely sharing info, talents, and context. The good news is that tools are available to help with that! Although collaboration tools don’t supply your team members with an individual desire to contribute (a key collaborative ingredient), they can eliminate the big obstacles and facilitate the most-critical working-together needs. Collaboration tools’ primary purpose is to help people work together. They give you a place to work together, providing features that enable collective contribution and work-product development. Tools come in general or specific forms, enabling people to make progress toward a goal at the same time (synchronously) or at different times (asynchronously), virtually or in person. Collaboration places are typically represented in one of two forms: An event-type place: A room where collaborators “go” (remotely or actually) to attend a synchronous collaborative session such as a meeting, a presentation, or a training opportunity A repository-type place: A display or data storage area where collaborators can display, store, or request contributions, including notes, comments or documents (tangible or electronic), folders, web pages, or text/multimedia information or databases Each kind of place can be physical or virtual/electronic. The following sections discuss the pros and cons of each setup. Physical places Employ physical places when you have face-to-face or collocated collaborators (those who work in the same building), because everyone is in the same setting and can easily meet and see the information whether they’re collaborating synchronously or not. The downside is that you can’t access information stored or displayed physically while working from home or traveling away from the office, unless additional support is provided (like shared copies of stored or displayed information). Face-to-face collaboration is especially valuable when issues are complex or teams or team members are new. If some of your collaborators have never worked together before, or if you have a particularly challenging topic to manage where constructive debate and resolution require a view of body language and vocal tone, then consider a set of initial in-person working meetings. Live meetings must be designed to get the team comfortable with their project topic as well as each other. Team members should spend a good deal of time on building relationships, cultivating trust and openness, and exploring and resolving the most critical or contentious project issues. Of course, in-person collaborators also typically need electronic storage or event options in cases where not everyone who needs to work together is present at a given time. Electronic places If you’re working with a dispersed and/or virtual team, electronic places are absolutely critical for you. Electronic repositories in particular (such as through a wiki or shared network drive) are useful when you’re hosting asynchronous collaborations and for keeping deliverables and outputs available for future reference. Team members that can self-retrieve information from a repository tend to be much more engaged and effective than those who get stuck waiting for another team member to send information out to them. Virtual collaboration works well when your collaborators have worked together before, share a sense for each others’ work style and personality, and feel a trust-based, collegial relationship. That doesn’t mean people need to have met in person before, but they must have had a positive prior experience together. Lacking that, they need a simpler problem to solve and an agreement that all participants will approach collaboration with a spirit of positive intent and openness and an initial giving of trust (instead of reserving trust until someone earns it). That history or start-up agreement provides collaborators a foundation on which they can successfully discuss and debate their project issues without animosity. Popular virtual collaboration tools provide key techniques and experiences typical to in-person collaboration, so you should look for features such as the following: Recording or viewing notes such as you would on a flip chart Drawing on a virtual whiteboard together Viewing the same thing at the same time, whether that’s a computer screen, document, presentation, demonstration or simulation, or an individual Seeing which team members are present or speaking and/or seeing their faces Chatting or discussing topics and getting or giving feedback vocally or in writing Splitting into break-out groups for focused discussion and then coming back and sharing results with the larger group You can also use specialized collaboration tools among your fellow BAs to improve your own analysis productivity and quality. Investigating Innovation and Idea Capture Tools Companies can lose a lot of time and money chasing ideas and testing concepts in the pursuit of innovation, so they need to successfully identify and distinguish the good ideas from the not-so-good as efficiently as possible. Innovation and idea capture tools capture and categorize information at any level and allow companies to get really good and important ideas identified quickly and easily. These tools are best used for enterprise analysis, before any projects or products officially begin. They allow analysts and business or product leaders to more effectively analyze feedback and respond to input from a variety of sources at once by consolidating information and providing new perspectives. Some questions facilitated or (sometimes) answered by innovation and idea capture tools are Where do we put all those ideas? Which ideas should we consider? What issues or products do they relate to? Which ideas are important? Where did those ideas even come from? What’s been done (if anything) so far to drive the idea forward? After the information is captured within the tool, you and the team can analyze it by Capturing, sorting, and categorizing information Identifying patterns in the information, such as emerging issues or trends Prioritizing the information and ideas according to relevance, importance, impact, or value to different audiences Identifying opportunities to improve services, products, or brand perceptions or to grow revenue lines across the business The following sections introduce high-, mid-, and low-tech tools and suggest some features you may want to look for in various options. Tools that provide idea or innovation support may alternatively get grouped into other specialized BA tool categories instead of being labeled innovation tools, so be sure to explore other places where you may find great innovation support, including early requirements definition, solution visualization or modeling, business case development with portfolio prioritization, and project management. Looking at the technology spectrum From a low-tech perspective, whiteboards and sticky notes are always great if you have to tackle brainstorming or elicitation. Each person puts her ideas on the notes (or board) and sticks them up on the wall, and then team members evaluate the collection of notes, rearranging ideas into groups or categories and determining how best to leverage the information next. Sticky notes are also great when you need to perform scoping analysis, data and process modeling, requirements management planning — you name it. From a mid- to high-tech perspective, the best tools are software-enabled solutions. Each tool works in a slightly different way. Some options include single or multiuser web-enabled tools, interactive whiteboards and smartphone apps, enterprise software as a service (SAAS) tools, and single-user computer tools. Considering specific features Look for mid-tech tools that provide help with collaborative generation; fast-capture or collection; organization; development; and evaluation of ideas, such as mind-mapping. If you need brainstorming aid features (such as leading questions or generation of visual associations), these tools can help as well. Just keep in mind that, after you’ve captured this information, you and the team have to analyze it, perform the critical thinking, and come to informed decisions on next steps. Following are some of your options. Listening tools Generally, users (such as external customers or internal employees) manually enter information (like suggestions and feedback) one idea at a time into innovation and idea capture tools. But if you need more-automated solutions, look for higher-tech tools that offer listening capabilities or customer collaboration web pages. Listening tools tap into social media outlets; listen for key words, product names, and brand references; and then import and compile that information within the tool for evaluation and review. Collaborative web pages allow companies to discuss specific product ideas directly and in more detail with customers or customer groups who care to give more constructive or forward-thinking feedback. Tools that track and grow ideas If your analysis efforts are going to continue beyond the discovery of the idea, look for tools that track and grow the discovered ideas. Different tools may address a broad or niche set of innovation activities. For instance, in solution development, innovation happens throughout the lifecycle as ideas progress from conceptual into solution decisions and from feature decisions into concrete design. Application lifecycle management tools If you need to carry your ideas forward to completion without having to transfer the data and maintain traceability back and forth between systems, look for application lifecycle management (ALM) tools — a growing trend in the business analysis world. These tools support requirements elaboration and definition from start to finish within one tool, eliminating the need to switch technologies as concepts develop. They enable business teams, software teams, and project governance boards to work better together through complete business solutions and software. These suites start with the initial ideas, suggestions, or customer complaints and then move them through innovation opportunities all the way into development management. Discovering Definition Tools Definition tools help you define requirements as productively and effectively as possible. (For details on what constitutes a requirement, head to Chapter 5 . Chapter 13 has more on the techniques for analyzing requirements mentioned in the following sections.) Some requirements are best defined by using only text, while other requirements are better served by graphical or visual definition. Definition tools support one or both of these styles, which we cover in the following sections. Textual definition tools If you need to define things like glossary definitions, project descriptions and objectives, and stakeholder analysis information, use a textual definition tool. Usually, BAs use word processing applications or spreadsheet programs to compile this information into paragraphs and tables; however, the information often turns into extraordinarily long documents. If you’d rather go for brevity, opt for index cards, markers, and sticky notes, which keep the bits of information manageable. Agile teams frequently use this approach to define user stories that capture the essence and goal of the requirements without getting too bogged down in tool or process overkill. They capture details about requirements on the index cards and then sort and organize the cards across conference room tables or tape them up on walls. (In this context, agile refers to a group of software development methods where requirements and solutions are developed through collaboration. Head to Chapter 11 to find out more about agile teams.) Quite a few electronic tools provide features and functions to define stories that mimic the look and function of the index cards! If you like that angle, look for tools with features that organize and define the requirements, acceptance criteria, and resulting project tasks in usable views and prioritized order. Modeling and diagramming tools When you need visuals, use modeling and diagramming tools. Models and diagrams frequently seen in business analysis efforts include the following: Business process flows and logical models of all flavors, such as •\tSwimlane diagrams •\tDecision models or diagrams •\tData models (entity relationship diagrams) •\tOrganizational or operational models Scope diagrams, such as a context data flow diagram System context or architecture diagrams Use case diagrams Process decomposition diagrams You can create these items by using low-tech paper and pencil or markers on a flip chart, which is very efficient. However, that result may not be particularly neat, formally presentable, or appropriate for your audience. In that case, some mid-tech tools speed your ability to create and update diagrams yourself with a computer; they feature buttons and menus for drawing standard shapes or creating clean lines. Some tools allow you to record meta data (data about data) with fields that define information about the boxes, lines, or information you’ve drawn on the diagram. Collaboration with mid-tech tools is manual, where one person drives the tool while others watch or contribute suggestions for the driver to address and incorporate. Opt for high-tech tools if you need to take it further. They have features for defining, modeling, elaborating, reviewing, simulating, and collaborating — all within a single tool or suite of tools. These modeling and diagramming tools provide features fused with other options that support definition by Creating diagrams for you: They generate items such as process flow diagrams based on a word, language, or grammar analysis of your textual requirements. Providing templates and techniques: They allow you to enter information in one manner while the tool translates the information for display in another manner. Offering workflow or notifications about requirements: Team members concerned with certain requirements get updates or changes the instant those items are documented but not any they don’t care about. Designing process code or generating development code based on the process models or design diagrams you create: This feature increases team efficiency. Creating or providing a central storage place where requirements can be more easily shared or reused across projects. Linking together and tracing all different kinds of requirements from and to one another: You can track requirements from original need to implementation/destination. Advanced features offering traceability ensure more complete requirements definition and enable you to perform gap and impact analyses around the solution, especially valuable on very large projects. (Check out Chapter 12 for details on requirement traceability.) Prototyping and simulation tools Prototyping is a type of definition and modeling tool, but rather than modeling process and manual workflow, you’re modeling screens and application work flow. Prototyping tools enable analysts and designers to imagine and illustrate what the software screens and applications will look like before they’re built, by leveraging drawings and wireframing (mockup) capabilities. When designed, users and stakeholders can review those prototypes and provide feedback early in the lifecycle rather than toward the end. Prototype tools can range from the very low-tech (paper, marker, whiteboard), to mid-tech (simple electronic drawing tools without many bells and whistles) to very high-tech and advanced (tools built for designers and artists whose focus is creating high-fidelity graphic designs). Simulation tools (sometimes called or created from pseudo-code ) are one variety of high-tech prototyping tool. Their features take prototypes a few steps further by activating them for stakeholders to try out; however, the screens don’t actually work. A simulation isn’t working software; it’s an active picture or application example that demonstrates how the functionality of software will work after it’s built in the future. These tools add value by supporting the fact that sometimes seeing is believing. If stakeholders can get a look at what’s going to be built, they can provide feedback about what they’d change before changing it is too expensive. For that reason, many definition tool vendors are incorporating prototyping and simulation features into their tool suites for full coverage. The more easily you can go from creation of requirements through visualization of the solution, the faster and cheaper the development effort! Reviewing Requirements Management Tools Requirements management tools initially came about to support larger companies. Projects so often went over schedule and budget or came under their scope that companies demanded answers. What was going wrong? Problem analysis identified requirements as the root cause of the delivery issues. Developers complained of changing requirements, testers identified that requirements were misunderstood (or flat-out missing), and project managers struggled to meet users’ and stakeholders’ demands without getting in trouble for differences between estimates and actuals. Requirements management tools reduce these challenges by tracking all the requirements as they progress through development. Use them when you need visibility across all the requirements and need to allow project managers to better manage expectations and issues. Look for tools to offer benefits such as in-flight (throughout project execution) key performance indicators and requirements metrics, among other things: Documenting the requirements after they’re defined Tracing the requirements: Identifying and recording which ones relate to others Managing the requirements: Tracking them through development and testing Identifying changes to requirements (and analyzing to determine impacts) Controlling changes to requirements: Facilitating discussions with stakeholders to decide whether changes are necessary and impacts are acceptable; recording agreements; and documenting adjustments to scope, schedule, and budget Requirements management tools are best suited for you if you’re a knowledgeable, senior-level BA providing repeatable processes; sound practices; and predictable results. Low- and mid-tech options Low-tech options for requirements management usually amount to manual tracking and management tricks, but more frequently, BAs simply track updates on the overall requirements document(s). One particular low-tech solution is gaining in popularity, and it’s great if you’re working with agile or iterative projects where user stories and cards are used: Requirements are managed by taping or pinning the index cards up to a wall and putting them in visually chronological order. You can also use a variation of this setup called a Kanban board, which tracks and manages work in a production flow model and shows requirements progress more clearly. A Kanban board has different columns depicting the different states or statuses of requirements during the development process (such as “In Definition,” “In Development,” “In Test,” and “Done”). You pin the story cards to the board within the specific column corresponding to their current state and move them along to the different columns as things change. If you prefer mid-tech options to track the information within electronic tools or spreadsheets, look for tools that provide sorting, calculating, tracing, and sharing (just note that these are manual efforts where frequent updates are necessary). High-tech options High-tech tools provide data entry features for getting the requirements into the tool. They offer workflow and status tracking to stay on top of which requirements are in whatever states of development or testing at whatever time, and they measure rates of change (often called volatility — the extent to which requirements continue to change and reach a stable state of definition) and other metrics. The high-tech options are the ones that really add the value for requirements management. If defined requirements aren’t entered and tracked in the tool, metrics can’t be generated on them. Luckily, greater incentives and opportunities are on the market today for getting data into the management tools, and now that requirements definition tools have matured, business analysis professionals are experiencing the benefits of tool convergence (both requirements definition and requirements management functions are now available within a single tool or tool suites). Picking the Right Tools for the Situation The key to finding the right tool is identifying the kind of support or productivity boost that would be right for you by inventorying the situation you have now and determining what situation you need or want to have later, while being sure to avoid unnecessary tools. You also need to consider team size and budgetary constraints. Review product offerings and functionality against your true needs very carefully. Consider specifically what you need to speed your definition work, and match your wish list of features to the product options accordingly. The following sections help you evaluate which tools best fit your project’s current and future state. Always make sure you get to know a tool and its feature set or benefits before you purchase or deploy it. If possible, try out or pilot test a tool first to accomplish a real-world business need. No matter how fantastic a collaboration or analysis tool may be, what’s ultimately useful must line up against what you need to do with it. Just remember: No tool — no matter how slick and cool — magically solves all your problems. Depending on what tools you pick in the end, you may need to get approval before deploying them, so keep that on your radar. For example, if the tool you want to use is fairly simple and economical (like index cards or sticky notes), chances are you don’t need to go through a whole approval process. However, if the tool requires a significant outlay of cash and/or resources, you need to make sure you’re cleared for the expense. To get approval, just follow the general business analysis process: Identify your needs and requirements, define solutions, and present your case to whoever has approval power. Inventorying the situation you have now Review the current characteristics of your team, along with the productivity challenges you’re having, and write down the following: What big-picture items (goals or end-products) you’re communicating or collaborating on What you’re collaborating about (topics, information, or areas) within those items Who’s adding to the collaboration (specific people) What your team members are contributing (words and information, pictures or drawings, physical objects, and so on) What the team members are doing with the contributions of others (assessing, enhancing, planning, managing, constructing, and so on) Where the team members collaborate (physical location and typical atmosphere/environment) At what time(s) of the day and for how long each individual is active in contributing toward the goal What business analysis-related challenge you’re experiencing (or expect to be experiencing) and what change or improvement would help facilitate or increase your (or your team’s) productivity Determining what situation you need later After you’ve inventoried your current situation (refer to the preceding section), identify the business analysis and other activities your team needs to perform as you collaborate on your project. What does your situation look like after you implement a tool? Look for gaps or challenges where you think your team can use additional support to become more productive — especially if you need to perform activities while separated by time or location. Here are some considerations: If you could all be together in one room, what would the optimal situation look like? What activities are taking place; what’s being created and how? •\tIs the team brainstorming ideas or generating plans? •\tAre you sharing or documenting knowledge and creating content? •\tDoes the team need calendars and schedules? Does work get done in a specific order? Would notifications at certain points be important? •\tWill the team be developing or creating things together? Will everyone need to just see and talk about what the leader is doing, will everyone have a hands-on role, or will some just need to review results when the work is finished? Will individuals have time to think about what they contribute, or will their contributions be fast and spontaneous? Does everyone on the team know each other, or are relationships still being formed? •\tWill people feel comfortable contributing, or will they need to be encouraged? •\tDo people need to see each other’s faces to engage effectively? Is the work product or collaborative output temporary for immediate use, or will it be used as input to a next step? Will team members need to go back to read and review contributions later or publish content for a longer-term? What historical information will you need to keep? Will people be paying active attention to the work and collaboration as it happens, or will they need to be notified or reminded about doing the next step? Will other people be paying attention to what’s going on with the team and try to find or pull information, or will you need to proactively push information out to them? What do you expect to generate at the end, and what happens next with it? That is, are you creating recommendations or information for someone to act on, a deliverable asset or thing someone can touch or leverage, a final end-product for an audience, or a component of work other team members need in order to do their work? Avoiding unnecessary tools and features Before you discount or leap to an electronic or particularly feature-full tool, consider how specific the analysis or collaborative exchange needs to be and whether the technology you have in mind is truly the vehicle to get you there . Don’t make the mistake of falling in love with features you don’t need. Keep the following in mind to avoid this fate: Don’t overengineer. If your primary collaboration requirement is to communicate with each other, keep things simple; a tool specifically for collaboration may be overkill if talking on the phone can do the job. If your needs start and end with your small team, a large high-tech tool may be completely overengineered or overcomplicated. Don’t get caught up in the flash of electronic tools. Be sure to look past bells and whistles to evaluate whether a tool really provides the needed functionality. For instance, some general collaboration tools provide visuals but no sound; some provide sound yet lack visuals; and some offer both. If sound is critical to your need, don’t get wrapped up in the amazing visual effects of options that don’t offer it. Don’t settle for virtual when in-person analysis or collaboration is really required. Think about what you need to accomplish and the kind of contact that enables you to do so. No matter what tools you use, connecting virtually still may not provide the value of an in-person event. Your collaboration topic may be best served by a real conference room and a travel budget, and without that, your results will be insufficient or ineffective. Money, money, money: Facing budget challenges Cash: It’s the big kahuna. After all, business all boils down to money. So before you invest a considerable chunk of cash or time on a productivity tool, be sure to consider what it’s really going to cost you and where the budget will come from. The initial expense or “purchase price” of your productivity tool may be the most visible financial component, but it’s not the only financial component. You have to consider a few other things when thinking about what budget you have versus what budget you need: Licensing or initial purchase of the productivity tool: What it costs “out of the box.” Installation or distribution costs for individual users: What putting the system in-place so it works properly costs. Training costs to get people up to speed : • Cost of time for people to attend training: Includes travel and expenses. Policies may differ among firms, so be clear on whether consultants get paid for any time they attend training. • Cost of effort for people or the vendor to deliver training: Travel and expenses and materials, books, and supplies. Annual maintenance costs: Ensuring that you get appropriate software upgrades and/or functional support from technical or customer service teams. Hardware costs : Basically, anything that may be paid for inside your company (or charged by the vendor) — such as servers, networks, backups, and security — that enables physical and technical support for your tool. Opportunity costs : The areas or opportunities that will be lost due to your implementing the tool. What will you not be able to purchase as a result of investing in this tool? What projects or specific requirements won’t be worked on as a result of your team’s spending time implementing the tool, developing and communicating new processes, and getting up to speed on how it works? What risks may you incur? Internal support costs : Whether someone inside the company needs to be a go-to support or help contact for the tool — both from the technical “help make it work” perspective and from the functional “help me work with it in our environment” perspective. You may find other cost components, but overall you should look for and analyze the various cost components that contribute to the total cost of ownership over the longer term. You should be able to clearly state to others whether the project will deliver as expected or you’ll need an extension, and whether the costs will end with the life of the product or project or go beyond the project lifecycle into the next project. Preparing Team Members for Change You’ve evaluated your needs, identified your options, and selected the best tool for you. Great! Now what?! Do you just go forth and implement? In some cases, perhaps (certainly if they’re small tools). But the large, high-tech, enterprise-wide tools are complicated, and they need to be implemented with care for true success. You can’t just buy a tool and toss it out there. People need time to plan and adjust. They need to know What the new process is (including training and additional time to get their work done) How they — and anyone else — are supposed to be working with the new tool Who they’re supposed to turn to for help when they’re confused or before specific details are all ironed out What benefit they’re supposed to get from this new tool that’s costing them energy and time To ensure a successful tool implementation, you should focus on two key areas to help get the team on board for the change: motivation and competence (more on building these areas in Chapter 15 ) . The key to motivating stakeholders to accept a new tool is to explain why it’s good for them. Always tie the discussion back to how this tool applies to each specific team member. When members know how and why the tool can improve their work, they become more motivated to accept and use it! Building competency with the tool requires that you provide a clear and thorough training plan, as well as support from all levels for integrating the chosen tool. Make sure you fully teach the stakeholders how to successfully use the new tool. People don’t like feeling confused and easily reject a tool that makes them feel like they’re not getting it. You can avoid that by making sure you’re in constant contact with users as they learn how to use the tool so you can guide them and address any concerns or problems right away. And don’t forget to check in along the way to solicit their feedback; sometimes they suffer in silence. Be sure to actively seek their input on the experience. A team with inappropriate training or without a clear process around a tool may just get aggravated and become decidedly unproductive. Although the new end-product may be the same or similar with a new tool, the actions required to finish typical work are commonly different enough to confuse even a senior analyst until she’s had enough time to practice. Whenever you bring in new tools to improve something, the situation always gets worse before it gets better. (We don’t mean to scare you; it’s just that to be successful, you must acknowledge the reality.) People first get excited about change, and initial expectations are high, but folks often become frustrated with the pace and reality of change (described in change management literature as the Valley of Despair ). As long as they don’t get so frustrated that they leave their new situation (an Exodus of Talent ), figuring out the new normal, adapting, and recovering their confidence takes a little time before they get back to or achieve productive performance.",

        "text": "Chapter 5 Understanding What Requirements Truly Entail In This Chapter Distinguishing between requirements and needs Crafting excellent requirements Getting to the heart of the four core components of requirements T he difference between a requirement and a need is at the heart of a business analysis project, but it can be a little tricky to understand. This chapter explains this difference and then explores how you can create excellent requirements. Defining Needs A need is an unsatisfied goal or objective. The concept seems simple enough, but needs can be rather hazy and subjective things that are difficult to identify or define. That’s because what people say they need is often not what they really need; it’s typically a solution they’ve identified to serve their need. For instance, maybe someone says, “I need clothes.” Perhaps he does. But why? Besides the fact that he may want new clothes, what’s the reason he needs clothes? If you as a business analyst (BA) were to ask him different questions in different ways, you could find out information that would help uncover the real need (without any covering, he’d be cold and naked; clothes help keep him warm and comfortable). Aha! Having clothes isn’t really his need at all; it’s a good solution for keeping warm and comfy, but technically, it isn’t the only option. Blankets, a space heater, and even a hot tub are all options that could potentially serve the need to be warm and comfortable. Typically, multiple options are available for serving business needs and solving business problems. But if you have lots of options for solving problems and serving needs, how do you make sure you’re giving your requestors the right solution? You must make sure you understand and truly address the real need and the real problem. As a BA working with stakeholders and eliciting their requirements (which we discuss in Chapter 6 ), one of the most important things you do is ensure you identify stakeholders’ real need(s) to be sure you’re solving the right problem. The business’s needs and the stakeholders’ needs may differ from and even conflict with one another. Therefore, identify and articulate the needs of each group separately. When getting to the bottom of what the real needs are, you investigate business needs (what the business must have or achieve in order to run) and stakeholder needs (what a specific stakeholder or stakeholder group needs in order to support the business). Knowing the difference between these two ensures that you plan and manage your project effectively. We cover both in the following sections. Business needs Whether public, private, or nonprofit, a business serves a market, executes a mission, and — presuming all goes well — fulfills the vision that the leaders have set for that business. Throughout the course of operations, business leaders set goals and objectives for their enterprise, and they rally teams to work hard and deliver on them. These goals and objectives are business needs; they are the things the business must have or achieve to run, to be profitable, to serve effectively, and to deliver successfully on its mission. Business needs defined at the highest level may include capability needs (statements about providing certain services, delivering a suite of products, assisting others in need, or ensuring the business’s own operational effectiveness) or improvement needs (suggestions meant to increase efficiencies or decrease costs, effort, or time-to-market). Articulating and defining business needs is a part of the activity called enterprise analysis and includes identifying and understanding the business’s goals; articulating its strategic direction; and capturing any key concerns pertaining to the business’s successes, challenges, risks, or problems. (For more on enterprise analysis, turn to Chapter 2 .) Successfully identifying business needs requires critical thinking, analysis, and insight. The business leaders of a company may not clearly tell you what they need, but they’ll probably suggest solutions they want, complain about capabilities they don’t have that’d be helpful, and talk a lot about opportunities they could go after if they only had the hottest new technologies. Therefore, you must do a lot of interpreting. Digging into the source of leaders’ wishful thinking can give you information about their business objectives and targets. When you work toward identifying why they need those things, you identify the core activities or drivers of the business. A popular business analysis acronym is IRACIS, or “increase revenue, avoid costs, improve service.” Typically, the business needs are related to one of these targets. To serve needs effectively, BAs must articulate What objectives or goals are being served or attempted in specific business area(s) What results or outcomes are desired What issues or problems are getting in the way What solutions are being suggested or considered for implementation or adoption in order to get the business needs met Outcomes desired versus problems perceived to be getting in the way of business success should be paired together in the analysis when identifying business needs, as shown in Table 5-1 . But that does not mean a problem and opportunity will always be expressed together. The business may express a problem without an associated opportunity or, conversely, an opportunity without an associated problem, as the third entry in Table 5-1 shows. Table 5-1\tPairing Problems and Opportunities ID Problem Opportunity 1 Manually tracking student registrations for classes takes too long. Automate the registration process. 2 Manually tracking instructor availability and other business rules is too cumbersome. Automate instructor availability and additional business rules. 3 Our competitors do all their scheduling manually, and we want to be first to market. You typically express business needs as broad statements characterizing strategic (and sometimes lofty) goals or as specific statements describing tactical objectives, such as what will be done by when. Consequently, effectively meeting business needs may require broad solutions, like a collection of organizations or operational stakeholders that participate in a variety of initiatives, subsequently designed to meet the objectives. Stakeholder needs Stakeholder needs are similar to business needs in that they also collect and describe information about business goals, strategies, objectives, targets, and key concerns about successes, challenges, issues, risks, and problems. Whereas business needs describe the needs of the enterprise itself, stakeholder needs describe what a specific stakeholder or stakeholder group needs in order to support the business. (They describe the needs of the stakeholder in service to his own objectives, while participating in initiatives or performing his role, but all in contribution to meeting the enterprise’s business needs.) Stakeholder needs look very much like business needs and are often mistaken for them. In many respects, stakeholder needs are business needs, which often confuses new BAs trying to understand definitions and the distinction. Analysts must ensure that stakeholder needs Are defined for the distinct and limited perspective of that particular stakeholder or group: If you have a lot of stakeholders to analyze, identify those with similar roles or goals and organize them into representative groups, as shown in Figure 5-1 . Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 5-1: Break stakeholders into smaller groups according to roles or goals. Convey only the needs relevant to the project and related to the stakeholder’s particular role: That role may be either supporting the relevant business needs or interfacing with the solution being delivered. Are separated for different stakeholders: Keep the needs of different stakeholders separated in organizing categories. Note: When you’re documenting needs for interaction between stakeholders, capturing the needs of both sides is frequently necessary. However, you must identify the specific needs for each side of the interaction separately to ensure that the solution ultimately meets the needs of each collaborator. For each individual stakeholder or group you analyze, you should capture the following: Specific organizational or operational objectives Any performance targets that either support or are affected by the overarching business needs or goals Any lower-level goals, activities, or processes that can potentially be served by the solution in question As you analyze, note specific issues and their root cause(s), as well as any aspirations the stakeholders may have for their own group’s performance or capability-building. Not all stakeholders are within the business you’re analyzing! Some stakeholders are outside your business (such as customers, vendors, or suppliers). Their needs for the solution may be just as important as the requirements of internal stakeholders, so be sure to look at all the business analysis artifacts at your disposal (such as process diagrams, data flow diagrams, business architecture diagrams, or backlogs) to find and include them. Defining Requirements Needs and requirements may look like they mean the same thing, but here’s the difference: The need is the objective, and the requirement is the decision about whether to do something to achieve that objective. A need turns into a requirement when someone recognizes that having the unmet need is unacceptable and decides he requires the need to be met. Requirements, when first identified, are really needs, wants, suggestions, or ideas — until the right person decides otherwise. Frequently, needs, wants, suggestions, and ideas are presented as requirements statements without the provider’s thinking about the needs, constraints, or implications of that decision; sometimes, he’s not even in the position to decide how or why the requirement is appropriate or necessary. Decisions are made by someone for a reason. Capture and note which someone makes which decisions about specific requirements, and when. As you’ve probably realized, the word requirement is a very vague term in the business analysis world. As a result, the official definition of a requirement listed in the BABOK Guide (as specified by the IIBA — the International Institute of Business Analysis) follows: 1. “A condition or capability needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective.” This point reflects the pivotal decision-making we mention earlier in this section. 2. “A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a solution or solution component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents.” This part shifts the focus from the stakeholder to the solution. 3.\t“A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2.” This idea notes that the documentation about requirements is also called a requirement. That’s because documentation helps analysts, different stakeholders, or documentation consumers (the people reading and interpreting the documentation) understand the requirements for the solution along with any components they’re responsible for creating. Because creators of the solution components must adhere to the requirements while developing, the documentation itself becomes a requirement. Requirements fall into different, layered categories as shown in Figure 5-2 . The primary categories include business requirements, stakeholder requirements, solution requirements, transition requirements, and technology requirements. Solution requirements include functional and nonfunctional requirements created either by hand or with technology (which has its own technical requirements). And when complete, the solutions are put into place by way of transition requirements. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 5-2: Categories or layers of requirements. We use these requirements terms consistently throughout this book to keep confusion to minimum, but some BAs and companies use different terms. The key is being able to identify what they are, despite what they’re called. You need to strategically analyze the business requirements in the top layer and then define or decompose the proceeding requirements so they clearly describe necessary capabilities for the next layers, and so on. Going straight from a business requirement directly to a detailed technical requirement isn’t possible. You must cascade through each layer or level of analysis as appropriate, cataloging and categorizing as you go. You and your team aren’t just supposed to design any solution at the end of all this cascading through the levels; you’re supposed to use the requirements to design a successful solution. You must probe deeply enough to elicit all the necessary requirements (for detailed info on eliciting requirements, head to Chapter 6 ); otherwise, you risk missing some requirements. You can reuse documented requirements (and needs, for that matter) at the business and stakeholder (and sometimes the solution) levels! Reused requirements can save project teams and stakeholders time and money. You should organize and save your requirements from your projects (perhaps in an enterprise repository or centralized requirements-reference place) in case you want to use them again on another project. Requirements that were once to-be requirements (for the future business environment) can become your as-is requirements (for the current business environment) and provide a new starting point for the next project. What versus how In business analysis, you have to differentiate between business requirements and solution requirements. These components are often referred to as the what and the how. What describes the business needs, problems, goals, objectives, information, and activities of concern independent of how these things are performed or managed now or potentially will be in the future. How describes the way business activities are performed or managed, including how and where business data is stored or how specific processes and tasks are executed. The how may or may not be automated by any technology or system. Separating the what from the how allows you to focus and clearly understand what the business area is and what the stakeholder problems are before getting distracted by slick technologies, innovative approaches, or an avalanche of details around how their problems should be solved to effectively meet their needs. Understanding and defining the what first (what do they need, what do they want, what must they have) is important because more than one how may be able to solve a problem. Business stakeholders may not necessarily care how problems get solved, but they typically do care very much about what they need to do or have after their problems are solved. Just one missing requirement can cause problems with the stakeholders and team members and can also affect the solution(s) you build. The solution may be lacking or costly, create ongoing quality or support concerns, suffer buggy or failing interfaces, put downstream systems in jeopardy, and result in systems that are (more) difficult to support, causing manual work-arounds or additional processes. These challenges can hurt user and customer satisfaction and business outcomes, which may result in decreased sales and an impact to revenue. Business requirements Business requirements are derived from the needs of the business; they’re the things that must be in place to benefit or serve the business or enterprise as a whole. They characterize and quantify outcomes desired for the business, and document what business the business decides to be in, what products the business will offer, or what markets the business will expand into or exit. At a project level, business requirements also include the reasons and objectives for the project, as well as the success measures and metrics that the project team will be held accountable to. All these requirements should be stated from a business perspective — that is, not specific to any one stakeholder but rather from the overall business view. Stakeholders often offer much more than just business requirements even if that’s all you’re eliciting from them. They may also provide stakeholder requirements, solution ideas, solution requirements, technology suggestions, and transition needs, so your challenge is being able to successfully peel apart that onion and identify which category each statement really belongs to. Distinguishing between an idea or suggestion and a truly decided-upon requirement that the team or solution will be held to support is especially important. This overload is the primary source for scope creep (when projects inch out of their previously determined boundaries). Stakeholders frequently see opportunity in every new development effort and may load up on “requirements” that they just “must have,” though those opportunities may fall outside the scope of the project objectives. ( Chapter 10 has info on defining and managing the scope of requirements for a project.) You may need to capture all these requirements but then defer their consideration to a later time. Stakeholder requirements Requirements that describe the needs or problems of the stakeholders in achieving or supporting their goals — whether related to organizational or operational concerns — are stakeholder requirements. Just as stakeholder needs and business needs look alike (as noted in the earlier section Stakeholder needs ), stakeholder requirements look an awful lot like business requirements. Stakeholder requirements define decisions about business needs, goals, and objectives — just as business requirements do — but from the perspective of the stakeholders and their role in the business. Stakeholder requirements are often just called business requirements because they are business requirements for a particular stakeholder. However, calling them business requirements may lead you to fail to isolate the true business requirements for the enterprise, which may result in your not identifying critical project or solution objectives in the process. In Figure 5-2 earlier in the chapter, you can see that stakeholder requirements, being the layer of requirements between the business and solution requirements, relate to both contexts. On one hand, stakeholder requirements define what functions the stakeholder performs (or will perform in the future) and what he’s responsible for. On the other hand, stakeholder requirements are also related to the solution: After the problem and potential solution become clear, they define each stakeholder’s potential interaction(s) with a solution, including the solution objectives, success, and acceptance criteria from the perspective of the stakeholder. Using stakeholder analysis to identify stakeholder requirements Prior to or during the elicitation and identification of stakeholder requirements, you perform stakeholder analysis in order to identify the stakeholders and understand their different characteristics. Information captured during stakeholder analysis may include the organizational positioning of a stakeholder and his level of influence and attitude (either within the business in general or with respect to the solution); his readiness for change; and his interest in the outcome of the project and solution. (Check out Chapters 3 and 11 for more on stakeholder analysis.) Stakeholder analysis information, together with the stakeholder requirements, provides a starting point for designing or modifying the solution, especially any automation aspects of the solution. Get stakeholders to clarify which of their requirements are, in fact, suggestions and which conditions or capabilities are so important that their needs wouldn’t possibly be met without them; stakeholders must identify what is truly required for a successful solution. The information gathered during the stakeholder analysis is also often called stakeholder requirements. In fact, the word requirements becomes the catch-all term for any information gathered during the business analysis process, which is why working on requirements is challenging and can trip up even the best of analysts. When requirements collide: Addressing conflict between stakeholder requirements Different stakeholders can provide different objectives and success or acceptance criteria for the same solution! As a result, stakeholders may identify individual requirements that unintentionally conflict when viewed in light of the overarching business objectives. Stakeholders have individual goals and objectives, but they still must collaborate to meet common business goals and drive the business. They sometimes lose sight of this fact, and it’s your job to remind them. Sometimes what’s best for the business overall may not be best for stakeholders individually, so you must influence stakeholders’ understanding so they can come to consensus on requirements (which we discuss in Chapter 3 ). Solving these conflicts provides opportunities for innovation, improvement, and business benefit. You create solutions from the requirements of many people, which means you may sometimes have to consider trade-offs and evaluate which stakeholder gets the most benefit or suffers the most risk. To do this task, you and your team need to understand all the important factors while defining the business/stakeholder needs but before deciding which of these needs merit being bumped up to a requirement. Otherwise, several consequences may occur: Stakeholders may feel as though they didn’t have a say in the plans or priorities; if they feel you weren’t listening, going forward, they may raise concerns later in the process than is helpful and may not buy in to important decisions. If stakeholders aren’t ready for impacts in their domain, they may end up lacking features or funding they need to transition. Team members may feel frustrated and overloaded at having to accommodate new requirements as they pop up, leading to missed deliverables, deadline or staffing challenges, and lack of time to plan or manage communications. Solution requirements Solution requirements specify the conditions and capabilities a solution has to have in order to meet the need or solve the problem and provide clarity around delivery needs. They don’t define how the solution will solve the problem technically or specifically; that happens later. Solution requirements must meet or support the driving project and business objectives, in addition to meeting stakeholder objectives. When developing solutions or solution concepts, stakeholders commonly focus first on identifying and writing software requirements and worry about the rest of the requirements later. But doing that without really knowing which features or functions will be most valuable in meeting the business and stakeholder requirements means your team may end up building some cool stuff without actually solving any important problem. You can’t really be sure what capabilities will be truly valuable until the overarching solution vision is clear. People get excited by technology or by finding great opportunities to improve. At this stage, beginning to brainstorm approaches or evaluate how something may be done or designed is very easy. Don’t let that happen! Instead, brainstorm about what the solution has to achieve for stakeholders before everyone gets caught up in the details of how to build it. Using a vision statement to define the solution A vision statement articulates and defines the holistic need for the solution. It’s the most important of all the solution requirements. The vision specifies which conditions and capabilities are critically required for the solution to effectively meet needs and deliver value. Developing a clear vision enables you and the stakeholders to focus on identifying requirements for what stakeholders need first, without inadvertently going too far down a single solution option path. Because many options are often available for solving a problem, you want to be sure to focus discussions on solution outcomes, results, and what-nexts and gain agreement first on what the solution has to support or enable. Without agreement on the overall vision, the requirements will end up just being a collection of stuff delivered without a solution delivered. Breaking your solution requirements into categories After you’ve got a vision, you can venture into breaking the solution requirements down into two different categories: functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements. Here, we describe them all briefly. For a more in-depth discussion, visit Chapter 12 . Functional requirements: Functional requirements define the specific behaviors, responses, information, rules, or operations of a solution. They outline • What functions or functionality the solution will support •\tWhat specific stakeholders will do or experience while being a part of or using the solution •\tWhat information or data will be managed •\tUnder what circumstances the behaviors and responses happen (or not) in order to ensure the required results and outcome Although functional requirements are usually specified in the context of software and technical system capabilities, manual solutions also have functional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements: Nonfunctional requirements specify the manner or the environment in which a solution is intended to operate. They describe the qualities a solution must possess and any supplemental expectations or conditions it must meet support. They define standards for • Usability: How easy the solution must be to understand or figure out • Reliability: To what extent users can rely on the solution to be accessible and work when needed • Performance: How quickly and efficiently the solution works and how it responds to commands and requests for action • Security: The level of protection the system and its data are expected to have in place • Design: The visual elements expected from the solution • Accessibility: The support that must be provided for users with disabilities, including hearing or vision loss, typically in compliance with relevant regulations such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 • Documentation: The type and extent of written documentation expected or needed • Information capacity: Requirements for the amount of data or media to be stored, including the expected growth of the information over time • Information architecture: Any needs for the arrangement or organization of the information in the solution • Anything else: Whatever else the stakeholders decide is required of the solution No matter what kind of solution requirements are identified and defined, those you elect to implement should be validated as capabilities that stakeholders really need and (as a result) decide must be included in the solution — either because including them is strategically, functionally, or technologically smart. Transition requirements Transition requirements define any and all temporary capabilities, conditions, or activities that are necessary for moving solutions out of development and into real-world business use. Here, we describe them briefly. For a more in-depth discussion, visit Chapter 15 . They do the following: •\tDescribe what has to be done with people, process, and technology before you can get from the as-is into the to-be. •\tCover awareness-building, education, and training for the new way employees must work, accounting for, and outlining the differences from before to now. •\tDefine any shifting, movement, enhancement, or change to data and information out of their original structures or locations into their new data homes. Technology requirements After the solution requirements are understood, a team has enough information to propose the best way for solving a problem, which frequently includes technology. Enter technology requirements. Technology requirements facilitate communications between the analyst and the technology engineers (system architects, programmers, and designers). In fact, sometimes technology architects or engineers are the analysts for technology requirements. Whoever writes the technology requirements has to make sure that they describe the specific characteristics of all the data and processes that will be implemented in the solution, including what the data should look like, how the processes should be done, and how the screens should behave. All the solution requirements previously specified get translated at this level from what the business decides it wants into how the solution will work and be built. Like stakeholder requirements, technology requirements have two perspectives or contexts: the business context and the solution context. In the following sections, we focus on the solution context because that is mostly what you’re concerned with as a BA. Technology (technical) requirements for the solution From the solution context, technology requirements are also known as technical requirements, and they specify the design and architecture of the specific technical components needed for the solution to be developed, implemented, and operated. They address how the solution will deliver the capabilities, be programmed or coded, and store and display the data. You shouldn’t create technical requirements until after the stakeholder and solution requirements are understood because which solution option is appropriate fully depends on what capabilities the stakeholders need from the solution. Not every technical “how” option will provide the same capabilities, so selecting the one that provides the capabilities that are just right for solving the business problem(s) is the key. Those designing technical requirements must balance cool, slick technology against stakeholder and business requirements. That said, you don’t have to do all the requirements for a solution prior to doing any technical work. Although teams can choose to define all stakeholder and solution requirements first and then do the functional/nonfunctional and technical requirements (a methodology known as waterfall ), they can alternatively work in a more agile or iterative fashion where they take one or a few abstract requirements quickly down to technical detail and then go back and do some more. (Refer to Chapter 12 for more on development methodologies.) Technology requirements for the business Sometimes, technology needs, problems/opportunities, standards, constraints, and requirements begin to take on a level of importance or significance above that of the technical requirements for any one specific solution; at that point, they grow into serving solutions broadly as a category or layer of requirements on their own. No matter what method you use for development and delivery, technical requirements get defined and implemented in support of many solutions over time in a business, enabling sets of stakeholders and serving many business requirements. As a company implements and grows its technology stack (collection of technology-enabled solutions), technology and even the technology industry begin to have needs as a stakeholder on their own. Making Your Requirements Excellent Your unique responsibility as a BA is to write and communicate excellent requirements. This job is important because requirements consumers depend on the requirements in order to effectively design and construct solution components. Excellent requirements leave no room for interpretation, create no cause for confusion, and omit no critical detail. They ensure that any consumer of the requirements information (such as developers, software or process engineers, database administrators, interface designers, architects, product managers, and sponsors) can understand what’s been requested. Excellent requirements possess seven different characteristics, which we cover in the following sections. Requirements that generate more questions than they provide answers aren’t excellent requirements; lacking that clarity, the team may find delivering the appropriate solution much more difficult and frustrating. Complete A complete requirement thoroughly describes the user task and all the information required to support that task. To create complete requirements, push stakeholders to focus on describing the goal to be accomplished and the requirements for achieving that goal, as opposed to talking about the system functionality. Focusing on system requirements often creates gaps because stakeholders frequently think of only the specific tasks that pertain to them. They miss critical interactions with or dependencies on others around the goal or outcome, and those elements are typically important for the overall solution. Here are two contrasting examples of completeness: Non-excellent/incomplete: “Accounting needs to be able to process employee expense accounts.” Excellent/complete: “Accounting supervisors need to be able to approve expense accounts submitted from employees.” Correct A correct requirement appropriately meets the goals of the project and accurately describes the user’s expectations of the functionality being specified. You must challenge and eliminate assumptions that occur when stakeholders who are very familiar with their business areas internalize different business rules or scenarios and then omit those critical details from their requirements. Here are two examples of varying correctness: Non-excellent/incorrect: “An employee may change his or her last name after a change in marital status.” Excellent/correct: “An employee may change his or her last name after submitting appropriate legal proof of name change.” Unambiguous An unambiguous requirement is crystal clear. Based on the requirement you wrote, all readers should arrive at a single, consistent interpretation. Misinterpreted ambiguous requirements can result in the wrong system being developed, a situation that may not be found during testing if the tester is working under an incorrect interpretation of the requirements. Here are two examples of clear/unclear requirements: Non-excellent/ambiguous: “Overtime is not permitted.” Excellent/unambiguous: “Any consultant’s time sheet that’s submitted with an excess of 40 hours worked will be denied for payment and returned to the consultant for revision.” Verifiable Excellent requirements need to be testable in order to verify that what you get when the solution is completed is what you wanted in the first place. Requirements that aren’t verifiable may be descriptive enough to be subjectively assessed, but they aren’t provable, which can complicate ensuring someone really got what was needed. Here are two contrasting examples of verifiability: Non-excellent/unverifiable: “Order fulfillment should be able to pack most orders within 5 minutes.” Excellent/verifiable: “Order fulfillment must be able to pack 90 percent of orders within 5 minutes after receipt of the packing slip.” Necessary Requirements need to clearly support a project goal or objective; they should not be on someone’s personal wish list, and they shouldn’t be requirements that anyone would review and declare to be scope creep. Every project operates under time and budget constraints; if a requirement isn’t necessary, it can be deprioritized. Here are two examples of levels of necessity: Non-excellent/unnecessary: “Accounting systems must have current, up-to-the-minute exchange rates available.” Excellent/necessary: “Accounting systems must have their exchange rates updated once daily.” Feasible Make sure that all requirements are technologically and realistically possible for a reasonable cost. To do so, bring in the technical team and discuss the requirements and potential solution options. Here are two examples highlighting feasibility: Non-excellent/not feasible: “The web system’s intrusion detection functionality must capture the reason for any intrusion attempt.” Excellent/feasible: “The web system’s intrusion detection functionality must capture the date, time, and IP address of any potential intrusion connection, as defined by intrusion-suspect criteria factors.” Prioritized After you decide that everything on the list is necessary, requirements must then be prioritized — just in case completing all of them right now still isn’t possible. Rank requirements from the business perspective, the technical perspective, or both. Facilitating these two perspectives involves some give and take: From a business perspective, prioritize requirements according to their value, level of risk, or expected frequency of use in the business. Stakeholders can characterize what they need by using declarative statements — they must have X, X should be present, or X would be nice to have. Also identify requirements that may be considered a delighter, or something stakeholders may find unexpected but exciting and value-adding. (This concept is sometimes important in commercial situations.) From the technical perspective, the technical team may need to implement requirements in order of technical importance or simplicity rather than by business importance. Requirements for compliance with governmental regulations, operating system upgrades, and other drivers may not have been initiated by the business but are still important to the business. Make sure the business understands why you’re prioritizing these items. Excellent requirements are not just textual statements. As we discuss throughout the book, requirements can be communicated in many forms: textual statements, diagrams, pictures, and so on. The characteristics of an excellent requirement apply to any form of communicating requirements. Focusing on the Four Core Components For each requirement, you have many different consumers, and you don’t want to overload any of them with requirements that they don’t need to worry about; otherwise, they may miss the things that are important for them. For this reason, requirements are broken down into four major core components: data, processes, external agents/actors, and business rules, which we discuss in the following sections. Organizing and presenting the requirements according to the core component they describe helps the consumers focus their knowledge-building and requirements assessment in support of the work they need to do. They won’t need to sort through and interpret or eliminate irrelevant requirements; they can instead review and understand requirements directly related to the portion of the solution that they are responsible for building. Additionally, organizing requirements by their core components helps you because you can look holistically at one core component and then cross-check across the other core components to seek out inconsistencies and gaps and ultimately identify missing requirements. Data Data is information that frequently gets stored. Whether it’s big data (such as volumes and volumes of multimedia or real-time information) or small everyday data (such as invoices, billing, sale projections, and personnel records), requirements for business data define what each piece of data is, what it’s for, what it means, how it’s represented, and what relationship it has to other pieces of data. You typically store information in a database with both a physical and a logical design. The database is a physical place with structures (tables and columns) that capture and organize all its data. Physical database designs represent the technical requirements for how the business data will be stored, and these are frequently designed by the database administrators or data engineers. The logical design reflects what the solution’s functional data requirements are to support the business needs. It’s called logical because it shows logically how the business thinks about the data and its interconnected relationships from the business perspective. The BA frequently defines logical representations of data requirements after the information is elicited from the business stakeholders. Defining business data from the logical perspective presents three major concerns: the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. We address those in the following sections. The business may want to store a lot of valuable information, but when it comes to the question of storage and whether the business would pay to keep track of it, you need to push your business stakeholders to think about their data requirements carefully, remembering that data stored must be maintained, managed, tracked, validated, and retrieved. Make sure you walk your stakeholders through the financial impact their data requirements will have. Entities Entities are the biggest pieces of business data, and they represent major information elements. An entity is a uniquely identifiable person, thing, or concept that the business cares about and wants to store information for. Entity data is stored within tables, but as a requirement, an entity is a named noun, described by a textual definition. Attributes Named with nouns or noun phrases, attributes capture the many details known about an entity. They are stored as columns within a table and are pieces of information typically included on screens, web pages, and reports. The most important kinds of attributes collect information about the business data entities. To make it obvious which attributes describe data fields for which entity, business analysts commonly prefix attributes with their entity name in capitals. Some examples are EMPLOYEE.first-name, EMPLOYEE.last-name, and BUSINESS-UNIT.name. Beyond the business information, you must also be concerned with attributes of the attributes. These characteristics describe the meta data about an entity and its attributes. Meta data is essentially data about the data. Attributes from a business perspective store business information about the entities, but attributes from a requirements perspective store information about the physical characteristics of each data field within the table. Clearly identifying what these characteristics are is critical for the data requirements and for ensuring the appropriate behavior of the solution. These sub-attributes include uniqueness and cardinality: Uniqueness: The first question to be answered about an attribute is whether it’s unique for every occurrence. For example, if the attribute PERSON.first-name is specified as a unique attribute, one and only one occurrence of that entity can have that value. If your personal information is captured within the solution, then no other person occurring in the database can have the same first name as you — ever. Cardinality: The second and third questions deal with the attribute’s cardinality (whether an attribute may or must have zero, one, or multiple values). First, you must determine whether the attribute is a mandatory field: Must data for this attribute be captured, or can the attribute value be left blank? If the attribute is optional, no data needs to be captured — blanks are okay. If the attribute is mandatory, something must be entered or an error will occur. In the first name example, if first name is mandatory, you must enter a name of some sort. You can’t enter anyone into the database and not know and record what his first name is. The third question is about repetition. If an attribute has or is allowed repetition, then the business expects to collect multiple valid values for that attribute. You must consider whether the business is describing a single-value field — where the entity has one and only one of these things — or whether the entity the attribute describes may have many (or a collection) of these attributes. Repetitive attributes are frequently used to allow business stakeholders to collect different types of the same attributes or the same attributes across different points in time. An example of a repetitive attribute is PERSON.address. Think about how many addresses a person may have now: a home address, a work address, a shipping address they prefer for deliveries, a billing address, and maybe even a vacation address. And over time, he may rack up several of each of these as he moves from place to place. Relationships The last major concern in data requirements is the data’s relationship to other pieces of data in a database. Relationships are defined by using keys, or relationship identifiers, that connect data tables together. They’re also attributes, but they’re special attributes in that they provide unique identifiers for individual data elements and denote relationships an entity has to other entities or attributes. Data relationships also have cardinality defined. You must define whether a relationship must exist (for example, if salary data is captured, it must be related to an employee) or is optional (a person may or may not have a dependent), and whether any relationship that exists is expected to be repetitive between the related entities (a person may have a relationship to more than one dependent). Process (use cases) A process is something a person or thing does that gets stuff done. It’s the collection of individual steps, activities, or other processes that together transform data and achieve an end goal (for example, “pay vendor invoice” or “find a local doctor”). Processes and use cases (written accounts of the sequence of steps performed by a user of an application to accomplish a complete business transaction) may be implemented as programs, modules, screens, or reports and can be manual (people perform each individual step) or electronic (systems perform each step). More and more, processes have elements of both, where a person does some part of the process and systems or technology does other parts, such as “balance checking account.” (Read more on use cases in Chapter 13 .) Process requirements can be documented and represented in many forms. Use cases are a popular technique for process definition, but other techniques such as user stories, process flow diagrams, or workflow models are equally, if not more, useful depending on the need or documentation audience. (See Chapter 13 for guidance on choosing requirements techniques.) Whichever techniques you use for requirements, the processes and use cases identified in those requirements are named with a verb phrase: verb and noun, where the verb is the transformation activity being performed, and the noun is the thing or piece of data being transformed. In technology-based processes, the documentation assures that modules and methods talking to the computer can access the right data, perform the right calculations, print reports, display screens, or correctly transmit information needed. In manual processes, documentation gives the people who will be performing those activities an idea about what needs to be done, what steps to take, and what data to access or provide. It also helps with actor identification, data calculations, and error or business rule checking. External agents and actors An external agent is the first person, organization, or system identified in requirements. Typically identified during the very early scoping part of a project, external agents are those with which the business area interacts. External agents either provide or are given information within the scope of the project or solution. Actors, typically identified later in the process, are defined at the solution level. Actors are people, systems, or devices that directly interact with a system or solution, but actors are always external to the system. In the requirements, actors are named for their roles or with a generic title of the responsibility being represented (no actual names or specific people). Actors become significantly more important in business analysis at the point where solution requirements are getting specific and more detailed at the functional and nonfunctional levels so that technical options and requirements can be effectively identified. Actor information, reviewed in context with their specific stakeholder and solution requirements, is critical to identifying and building the specific interfaces needed by the actors, as well as defining any security access requirements. Actors interact with systems or solutions through an interface of some kind. Technical interfaces have different forms of implementation, and depending on the complexity of the interface, the requirements needed in order to effectively design and develop it vary. Systems or devices always interact with solutions by using electronic interfaces; however, our human friends may have more diverse interface requirements. Core component requirements related to actors and agents include references to processes they perform, data they transform, and the business rules that govern or constrain their actions. Actor requirements are typically functional requirements and should outline information about the following: The screens and reports they need to see or use Data of concern Validation requirements for their data, specifying what is or isn’t acceptable based on their role or any events Instructions needed by the actors for how to use the system (usability) or guide them in changing what they’ll do after the solution is implemented (transition requirements) If you find yourself immersed in interaction or usability design concerns, turn to the experts! Design engineers, product designers, and human factors engineers all have a specialty in psychological science and/or human-computer interaction and therefore can be terrific advisors or advocates for good interaction design (and experts on what not to do). Business rules Whether implemented in a technology solution or not, business rules define the way that a business works. They provide a model for how a business runs and manages its enterprise; describe the governance framework for the processes, data, and actors within the business; and define the business logic that ties together the data, processes, and agents/actors. Business rules are the defined control or constraint conditions under which an actor may (or may not) perform or complete processes or actions and/or successfully view or transform data. Overall, business rules provide for different outcomes or results. Positive business rules give permission or allow something to happen, such as “employee is given one additional vacation day credit after 2 years of employment,” while negative rules restrict actions or data values, as in “check number must be greater than 99 and less than 9,999,999.” The solution should not allow business leaders, processes, policies, or data to be undermined or compromised by allowing actions or data changes contrary to business operating procedures, regulatory policies, state or federal laws, or any other relevant stakeholder rule. Facing the special challenges of discovering business rules Writing excellent requirements, as explained earlier in the chapter, gets most challenging when you’re defining business rules because business stakeholders frequently don’t realize the circumstances under which they make decisions or allowances. In fact, stakeholders may not even recognize that certainly policies exist if they haven’t consciously thought about them. Identifying and isolating the decision factors in the business rules that govern the work or the data is considered a bit of an art. A whole segment of the business analysis industry — including many specialists and technology solutions — devotes itself solely to the art of identifying and managing business rules, decision models, and decision automation. Barring those tools, you as a BA must be able to recognize cases where a business rule exists and at least write down its description or outcome at a high level. Then work with your stakeholders to figure out all the exceptions to that rule — because those exceptions usually turn out to be the primary business factors and decision criteria. Work can be done or situations resolved in plenty of different ways, but in a business environment, the decision about whether or how something will be done depends on different decision criteria or factors. Evaluation factors such as data values, security rights, order of events, or timing of actions can all play a part in determining whether something should or will be allowed to occur within a system or solution. For instance, a business rule may be “benefits enrollment is allowed only 90 days after hire date or during the open enrollment period.” But to identify the outcomes and exceptions, you really need to dig beneath the surface and ask the stakeholders things like “What if the employee is a rehire working here for a second time? Which hire date gets used in the evaluation of this rule; does the rule mean 90 days after the latest hire date? What happens on day 91?” Considering cardinality for business rules Business rules also have cardinality (described in the earlier section Attributes ). The business must decide whether rules are optional or mandatory. Optional rules allow actors to perform the action or transform the data despite a suggestion to the contrary. They show themselves through warnings or what we like to call ask-the-user-first prompts. You’ve probably seen one of these while using your own software solutions — after requesting an action or trying to update information that goes against what the system is supposed to do, you may have been asked something along the lines of “Are you sure?” or “You’re not supposed to do that; do you want to do it anyway?” If the actor isn’t a human who can immediately respond to warnings but rather is another system, warnings or optional rules either will be suppressed and not seen or will be documented on a report or exception log that tracks the success or failure of the interface transactions. There, you see a list of messages raising concerns about the data transmissions or changes, and suggesting that the specific transactions be reviewed or issues resolved. Mandatory rules create errors for the actor, who experiences a block or pause in the workflow such as a message or window that stops the activity until the actor responds to the error and resolves the issue. A familiar rules-based error is “wrong password, try again” (the accompanying mandatory rule may be “user must provide a valid username and password for access”). In system interfaces or batch jobs (automated, unattended data transformations or information transfers), errors may result in data not being processed or transmitted at all. In that case, errors are commonly recorded and reported through the exception/error log for later review and resolution.",

        "text": "Chapter 6 Hunting for the Right Information, Part 1: The Process In This Chapter Asking the right people the right questions Previewing elicitation approaches Making sure your language helps rather than hinders Organizing your information to make a plan S o the time has come to sit down with everyone involved in the project and figure out what each person’s problems are so you can eventually help solve them — well, some of them, anyway. (You can leave the rest to their therapists and mothers-in-law.) Easy, right? Not so fast. Even though the project’s stakeholders may tell you otherwise, identifying a company’s problem and corresponding requirements isn’t as easy as just asking people what they think is wrong and how to correct it and then simply implementing their suggestions. After all, doctors don’t remove your gallbladder just because you tell them you think the gallbladder is causing your stomachache, so why should you put a solution in place for a business without doing your own thorough and specialized investigation? Even though you’re not performing brain surgery (or the aforementioned psychotherapy) here, following certain techniques is just as important to the success of your project. The information in this chapter explains the process you use to elicit the information you need to get to the root of the problem. For the tools you use to perform these tasks, head to Chapter 7 . Elicit, Don’t Gather: Developing the Right Questions To get your stakeholders to reveal the real issues, you have to do a bit of hunting. See, stakeholders aren’t just sitting like ducks in a row around the conference table with all the problems and answers outlined for you on a nice, neat, big master list. Chances are that each person has a different perspective of what’s wrong and how to fix it. Or maybe they’re just telling you (or their boss) what they think you want to hear. Or perhaps they don’t even know what the real problem is or how to fix it. To be successful in your analysis, you must go beyond just gathering up whatever information the stakeholders present to you and elicit requirements instead. (For the basics on requirements, flip to Chapter 5 .) If requirements were simply lying around to be picked up like ticker tape on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, you wouldn’t need business analysis at all! Maneuvering about the human mind takes skill, finesse, and cleverness. Eliciting requirements is all about knowing how to design and ask a question, topics we explain in the following sections. (For more on communicating effectively with different stakeholders, turn to Chapter 3 .) Put the time in early! Develop questions prior to the elicitation session to make the most of it and drive out the information you need. Identifying the type of question you want to ask The first step in developing the greatest questions ever (or ones that really get to the problem or opportunity anyway) is to figure out which type of question — “what,” “how,” “why,” “when,” or “where” — you want to ask based on the information you need to obtain. To determine which kind of question best suits your purposes, consider what you already know, what you don’t know, and what information you need to get started. In the following sections, we tell you which questions elicit which kind of information and give examples of these questions in action. You can find more sample questions by using templates, interview worksheets, brainstorming sessions, and other tools. “What” questions The answers to “what” questions help you build a general, big-picture framework so you can start filling in details with the other types of questions later. The answers to “what” questions provide information on the scope of the problem or a description of the problem. They get to the basics of the basics — the heart of the matter, the bottom line. “What” questions are questions such as the following: “What is the problem you’re attempting to solve?” Usually, businesses undertake business analysis projects to solve business problems. By understanding the problem a business is facing, you can best guide the follow-up questions to glean what the business really needs. Suppose you ask this question and get the answer “I can’t enter detailed notes about my customer contact.” With that info, you now know to follow-up with questions such as “What are the types of customer contact? What types of customer(s)? What types of customer contact call for notes?” “What is the opportunity you’re trying to take advantage of?” Sometimes the company doesn’t actually have a problem; it just wants to take advantage of an opportunity. For example, Apple didn’t create the iPod because people were sitting around listening to their portable CD players and saying, “Man, it’s a problem that I can only listen to 12 songs at a time on my portable music device.” No, Apple designed the iPod to hold more than 1,000 songs in order to take advantage of an opportunity the company saw. Apple’s answer to this “what” question probably would’ve been something like “We want to take advantage of a shift in the music industry to connect a music device onto a portable hard drive. Users can then carry around their entire music library with them.” With that info, you’d then have been able to follow up with “What is the goal of the project? What indicates success? What revenue opportunities do we have?” “What is the information/data you need to record and store?” Businesses live on information, so they have to understand the data they need. Asking “What information do you need in order to make decisions in your daily operations?” leads to follow-up questions such as “What does order history mean? What does customer profile mean?” “Who” questions If you need to know the people involved in any given aspect of the project you’re analyzing, ask (you guessed it) a “who” question. The answers to “who” questions help you understand not only the people but also the systems within the scope of the project. You really get a sense of who’s turning the cogs and how they all relate to each other. And the relationships that “who” questions uncover can prove to be some of the most revealing information of all. “Who” questions are questions such as these: “Who will be creating the information?” Answers to this question can lead you to discover stakeholders who may not have been identified in the beginning. Follow-up questions may be “Why is she the employee who creates this information?” and “Who does she collaborate with to create it?” “Who will be using the information?” Just knowing who creates the information is only one piece. Knowing who receives the information also helps you understand how many people are involved and how information should be communicated in the future. This question can lead to follow-up questions such as “Who are the people in that organization?”, “What are their skill levels?”, “Who do they interact with?”, and “How is the information passed from the creator to the user?” “Who is impacted by the solution?” When you understand the people impacted by your solution, you’re in a much better position to understand the direction and effort you need to put into the solution. If your answer is “toddlers” (meaning that you’re building software designed for young kids, not that you consider your users childish), you’re going to approach the solution differently than if the software is for adults and has to interface with Microsoft Office. Don’t think the who is important? Asking “who” questions can lead to your finding people affected by the solution whom you may not have included in your project scope. On one project Paul worked on, the sales department had initiated a project to have call center agents (rather than the more-expensive sales force) pre-qualify sales leads. Great idea from a cost perspective, but no one told the call center folks, so they were unprepared. After they were informed, the project had to increase its scope and budget to account for training the agents on their new responsibilities. If “who” questions had been more thoroughly explored, the team wouldn’t have missed identifying, looping in, and training the call center as an important part of the project. “Why” questions If you want to understand the reason behind the project (or maintenance request), ask a “why” question. On the surface, this question type gets you to the motivation behind the request. But it can also unearth deeply hidden information because it requires stakeholders to really be conscious of their operations. Think about it; doesn’t everyone fall into a sort of autopilot-driven routine at work? The “why” questions flip that switch back into manual mode and force stakeholders to think about what they’re doing, which is super important for your analysis. These queries are great questions to lead you to the motivation or the reason the company is spending money pursuing this opportunity. Here are some examples of “why” questions: “Why is the company pursuing this opportunity over another?” “Why did the company decide on purchasing that software over other available options?” “Why are we rolling out a requirements management tool right now?” What you may really mean by this question is “Why are we buying a requirements management tool when we haven’t even defined our internal processes yet?” but phrasing it the second way may be politically volatile. The former version addresses the same issue in a more neutral way. “Why is the ROI (return on investment) 2 percent over 10 years for this project?” “Why are we furloughing people with the highest intellectual capital in the company?” “Why isn’t the company changing to keep up with the times?” “Why” questions don’t always produce direct answers right away; you may get responses like “because that’s the way we’ve always done it” and the business analysis version of the parental standby “because I’m the parent, that’s why!” In these cases, figure out what the stakeholders don’t understand or why they don’t want to share. Rephrase the question (“Why has it always been done that way?” or “Who first did it that way?” for example) and go find the answer together with them. “Why” questions can be tricky. They can have a negative impact if they’re not asked the right way. They can easily put someone on the defensive. If you feel leading the questions with “why” will be problematic, start the questions with “What was the reasoning behind . . . .” This approach gets you to the answers you need, without making someone try to defend his or her rationale. “Where” questions If you need to understand where something is happening, ask a “where?” question. “Where” questions help you understand data sources (“Where is the data kept? Where do you get the data? Stakeholders, where does the data come from?”) and can also help with planning (“Where are those users located?”) Some examples of where questions include the following: “Where is the data coming from?” Maybe it comes from users giving input or is pulled from another system or an outside source. Knowing the source of the information can help you plan interfaces or look for alternate sources of data. It can also reveal duplicate sources of data within your organization. “At what point is the process most inefficient?” This question may seem like a “what” question, but it’s actually a “where” question because it enables you to pinpoint the location of bottlenecks and other inefficiencies. Sometimes, you have to be crafty, especially if you’re asking questions whose answers may put people on the defensive, just like “why” questions. When you experience this situation, think about different ways to ask the question, such as “Where is the bottleneck?” or “Where do people have the most problems?” The latter questions are not-so-obvious ways of getting the same information from your stakeholders. “Where are the stakeholders themselves located?” or “Where are the people I’m eliciting requirements from located?” Knowing the answers to these questions helps you plan your elicitation sessions. For instance, knowing your stakeholders are located halfway around the world alerts you that you can’t just plan to stop into their offices and ask them questions; you may have to rely on phones, video conferencing, and other technology. Knowing the proximity of resources and stakeholders is a vital piece of the “how long is this project going to take” equation because this knowledge helps you create an effective and efficient approach for project elicitation. For example, if many of the resources you need are offsite, you know to add time in for that situation when planning your project. And as the project’s timeline and resource needs increase, so does the budget. “When” questions If you want to know the time aspect of something, ask a “when?” question. The “when” question gives you an idea of, well, when the problem or the trigger for a process occurs. The answers to “when” questions also give you more clues about how all the different stakeholders and tasks are related — key information for your overall understanding of the project. Some examples of “when” questions are “When do you experience the problem?” Automotive service technicians often ask questions like “When do you experience the steering wheel shaking — just when you brake, or all the time?” and “When does the car refuse to start — in the morning, after a rainstorm, or all the time?” They’re trying to narrow down the situations in which a problem occurs by asking leading questions. The process is the same in business analysis. You identify possible triggers while ruling things out. For example, if you’re working with a healthcare provider who’s experiencing problems with timely billing of patients, you may ask, “When does the patient hand over the insurance card?” The answer to the question can help you determine when the doctor’s office has the patient information, whether the doctor can see the patient, and when the office can bill for the service. “When do you perform this process?” This question helps determine the level of effort and priority associated with the request. For instance, if the process is performed hundreds of times per day, that process may be higher on the priority list than a process performed once per decade. (Sometimes, users may even say they can’t remember the last time they performed the process!) “When does the process begin?” This question helps you understand not only the triggers for a process but also the users’ understanding and recognition of the process. Asking users when the process for pumping gas starts helps you understand what they consider “pumping gas.” Does the process start when they pull into the gas station? Pull up to the pump? Get out of the car and swipe their credit card? “How” questions The “how” question primes the pump for getting down to a solution. The answer to a “how” question helps you understand the current way in which a task or activity is done or the impact a change has to a business area. It’s another layer of detail in your big picture. Examples include the following: “How does this problem affect the way you work?” This information helps you understand the impacts to the business area. Knowing these effects, you can plan your solution and analysis phases and strategy (more on this in Chapter 11 ). As you uncover some of the “hows” in the process, you may also identify some stakeholders. “How will these changes affect your business area?” This question gets to the core of transition requirements (see Chapter 15 ). After you know how the specific change affects the stakeholders, you can plan for solutions to help ease the transition and change and account for training, migration, and preparing for the new solution. Identifying appropriate sources of information The type of question you ask determines your source, so after you have your type of question figured out, you know who to go after! At this stage in the game, you may not have actual names of stakeholders; you may only be able to identify your sources by titles or positions. Review the company’s organization chart and ask questions about any positions that are unclear. Then go through the chart and pair questions with the positions and titles. You generally direct “why” questions to the higher-ups in an organization, while the lower-level employees doing the day-to-day work are a fit for “what” and “how” questions. This approach makes sense if you think about each person’s position within the organization. Employees in managerial roles typically understand more of the strategy — the why — behind performing a particular procedure and are more likely to understand interactions with other processes or departments. CEOs, directors, and managers can all put the operations within a great mission-driven context for you, as well as tell you how everything should run (or at least how they think it runs). The people actually performing the job can (usually) tell you exactly what they do and provide you with the step-by-step instructions or procedures that outline how to do it. That is, the line staff can tell you what really happens in those trenches. The sample organization chart in Figure 6-1 illustrates this division. For example, if you want to understand how the sorters perform the sorting process, who should you ask? The sorters. Why? Because they do the job day in and day out. True, the line manager may once have been a sorter and probably still knows how the process works, but she now has more management responsibilities. The farther you go up the org chart (business lingo for organization chart), the farther away from the day-to-day operations of the business process you get. If you need an answer to the question “What are our sales quotas for all regions in the United States?”, however, you ask a higher-level manager. The sorter, though able to figure out work-arounds and alternative ways to accomplish the process, may not be aware of this information. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 6-1: Organiza­tional chart. Every day a manager is out of the hands-on operations of her business, the more she loses the knowledge of the how a procedure is done. We like to say these managers start losing their “SME-ness” (or subject matter expertise) each day they aren’t performing the subject matter, so keep that in mind when pairing sources with questions. Here’s another example: Suppose the business has received complaints about shipment deliveries. According to Figure 6-1 , you’d ask the operations manager and possibly the area supervisors questions like “Why is this a problem for the company?”, “What are the current profit margins?”, and “What is the impact to future sales and customer service metrics if we don’t fix this?” Then maybe you’d ask the line manager and sales manager “Who was assigned to the specific deliveries in question? How were they trained?” Then you’d ask the sorters, salespeople, and assemblers questions that reveal the nuts and bolts: “What are the processes we perform to sell a product, take an order, assemble it, and deliver it?” and “How can those processes be improved?” Choosing an Approach Not only do you need to identify your sources within an organization, but you also need to choose an approach with which to elicit information. You can use 11 major elicitation techniques to draw information from your stakeholders (we go into more detail in Chapter 7 ): Document analysis: Look through existing documentation to figure out questions you want to ask stakeholders during your elicitation sessions. Observation: Watch business users perform their tasks to get firsthand insight into a company’s true operations. Observation is an excellent technique to use when you want to automate a manual process, for instance. It’s also a great way to establish rapport with your business users by performing the processes yourself. One of the best ways to understand how the business does its work is by doing the work right next to the business. However, this approach does have its limitations in certain industries and tasks. For instance, you may be able to learn by experience how an administrator resets someone’s password on a computer system, but you most likely won’t get to learn how to land a 747 jumbo jet by actually landing it. Interviews: Ask probing questions of your interviewee to understand answers that will become your requirements. Surveys: Use these items to track metrics and elicit requirements from a large number of stakeholders located in a lot of different areas around the world. Requirements workshops: Use this technique, sometimes called facilitated work sessions or Joint Application Development (JAD) sessions, to bring project team members together in highly structured, focused meetings led by an independent facilitator (possibly a business analyst [BA] or project manager [PM] not closely related to the area) to develop high-quality requirements. Brainstorming: Get team members (and stakeholders) together to develop creative ideas to approach a specific problem or attack an opportunity from a different perspective. Allow ideas to flow creatively with the hope that an out-of-the-box solution arises. Focus groups: Pull together a randomly chosen group of individuals that meet a particular demographic to discuss a particular product or service. Focus groups are used mainly by retail businesses. Interface analysis: Examine documentation and discuss with technical stakeholders the interfaces among systems, people, and hardware to understand system impacts (how the data/process interacts with your system and another system). Prototyping: This method is ideal when you’re working on a computer-based solution. Develop a model of the computer screen being developed as a solution so users have a picture of what the solution will look like. When creating prototypes with the business users, bring in the technical team. The technical folks can not only help with design suggestions but can also help guide you so you don’t create a solution that can’t be implemented. The result is that the business users don’t get something in the end that they didn’t see in the prototype. Reverse engineering: Take apart a product to see how it’s built. With software, this approach may mean looking into the code to find out how it sets values and enforces business rules. For example, when you look at how a formula calculates a value in Microsoft Excel, you’re reverse engineering. Competitive analysis: Look at the competitor’s products to see what the minimum features your company has to offer in order for your product to be successful. We explain all of these approaches in great detail in Chapter 7 , but for now, knowing which technique works best based simply on the number of stakeholders goes a long way in helping you get started. To choose an approach, figure out how many stakeholders you need to elicit information from on the project and then match that number up with the elicitation technique. You may find Table 6-1 helpful in deciding. (Keep in mind that the pairings in this table aren’t hard and fast. Use them as a starting point for selecting your elicitation techniques.) As your business analysis skills evolve, you’ll probably find one technique you prefer over others. That’s fine. But remember that you can fall back on other techniques if you find you’re just not getting the information you need from your stakeholders. Using Clear, Consistent Language Forget everything your creative-writing teacher taught you in middle school; being predictable and repetitive when you’re eliciting information is good in the world of business analysis! When eliciting, use the clearest communication you can. Make your sentences concise and complete. Avoid long sentences that keep going on and on and on and don’t end and have multiple clauses that keep linking together and leading to a difficult way of interpreting the sentence (sort of like this sentence). The next sections highlight the key components of clear business communication and explain how you can frame your questions in a way that gets you the information you seek. Choosing terms consistently Stay away from using unnecessarily creative words and mixing up terms just for the sake of keeping your readers engaged. Pick a term and stick with it for maximum clarity in your communication. For example, don’t mix terms such as customer, account, and client interchangeably to describe the same type of person. Instead, you may choose to use only customer; if you need to differentiate among different segments of the customer pool, you can describe them with different statuses such as current, potential, preferred, and so on. To you, choosing one term among many that are similar may seem like mere (and innocent) semantics, but your job is to understand the company’s culture and respect what its words and definitions mean. Inconsistently using terminology can confuse your audience and lead to things like incorrect security access to the solution (that is, you may end up giving the wrong people access to features they weren’t supposed to access). Using language that’s consistent with the company’s language Each company you work with has its own terminology. For instance, Disney calls all its customers “guests” and its employees “cast members,” and it uses this terminology in every communication and interaction. Adopting the company’s language is important; doing so not only lets you avoid confusion but also reiterates that you’re aware of and understand what makes this company unique, a key trait in someone targeted to devise solutions. Here are some suggestions for making sure your language is consistent with a company’s: When encountering new terms, ask for the definition. Understand what the company means when it uses a word like customer, client, or guest. Each time you find a term you don’t understand, ask for clarification. If you find a term very close to one already defined, ask your stakeholders if the new term is the same as the previously defined term. If so, ask them to select one to use as the preferred term. Create a glossary for yourself and for the project team. Record all terms and company lingo so you can refer to them throughout the project. Unless you’ve been working with a company for a long time, avoid making assumptions about terms (or anything in general, for that matter). Make sure you clearly define all language before using it. The clearer you are and the more you let stakeholders explain, the less chance you have for miscommunication. Don’t be afraid to ask a question that might seem to have an obvious answer. If unsure, just ask. Framing questions that clearly reveal core needs We’re sorry to say that even if you already understand the people you need to interact with, their level within the company, and the elicitation techniques you plan to use to draw out the information, you’re still not quite ready to jump in. To get the real truth out of your stakeholders, you have to properly frame the questions, or ask your questions in such a way as to drill down to the real business or stakeholder need rather than just the suggested solution. Frame your questions correctly, and you may even find a completely different problem than the one the stakeholders suggested. Imagine, for example, that a stakeholder states this requirement: “Open the address field on screen 1.6.” Asking a question about what problem led to that request may reveal that the stakeholders need to track comments around customer contacts and saw an unused address field that would work perfectly for their solution. What they didn’t know was that using the address field for something other than an address would lead to non-address data residing in an address field, which may cause a system failure due to dirty data. So how do you frame a question properly? So glad you asked. Ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions are questions that stakeholders can’t answer with a simple yes or no. For example, ask “What are the problems you experience?” rather than “Do you experience slow response times?” Figure out what the stakeholder is asking for. A great place to start is with asking “Why does this stakeholder need this solution?” or “What is driving this request?” Your goal here is to uncover the real problem rather than just put in a solution, because putting in the solution doesn’t get to the root cause. If you fix the wrong problem, the business may end up blaming you, the BA, for not fixing the problem even though you did exactly what the business asked you to do. For example, asking “Why are you looking to open the address field on screen 1.6?” helps you understand why the stakeholders are approaching a solution to a problem so you can understand the real problem. In this case, the original requirement presented to you — “Open the address field on screen 1.6.” — was really a solution to an underlying problem. Think about answers that may elicit a follow-up response. Elicitation is not all about asking questions. It is about listening, too. Be careful not to jump ahead to other questions on the assumption that you know where the answer will take you. Listen to the answer to a question and ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand the answer fully. Make your questions relevant to the business. Although you don’t have to be a domain expert to be an excellent business analysis professional, you do need to do your homework. Make sure your questions apply to the project and business area you are working with. “What business problem is the business attempting to solve?” “What would an ideal solution look like?” Planning Your Elicitation Sessions After you’ve designed all your questions as we discuss earlier in this chapter, it’s time to arrange it all into a master plan to take over the world, muahahahahaha! Oh wait, that’s a different book. Sorry. Seriously, though, you’re ready to lay everything out so you can move forward and get the information you need. The plan is also vital for keeping everyone on the same page and keeping your session — and therefore, the project — on track. Elicitation occurs throughout the project, in different phases and from different people. In fact, it occurs anytime you capture project information. The key of any elicitation session is to note what info you need to capture, whom you need to capture it from, and when you can capture (a meeting schedule). Planning your elicitation sessions isn’t an exact science; it’s really more of an art. However, we have a rough checklist for you to follow as you lay everything out and capture the project information: 1.\tDetermine how many systems you’re interfacing with. Knowing how many systems are involved helps you identify the stakeholders you need to elicit information from in order to understand interfaces, data, processes, and business rules. 2.\tDetail the number of stakeholders you’re eliciting from. By knowing the number, you can determine which elicitation techniques work best. 3.\tFigure out where the stakeholders are. Eliciting from people who work in the same office as you do is different from eliciting from people in another state (or even halfway across the world). You may choose similar elicitation techniques for each group, but the meeting tools you choose may be different. For instance, you can still have a facilitated workshop, but instead of physically gathering stakeholders together in one meeting, you may have to use an online meeting tool. 4.\tOutline your stakeholders’ personalities. Are they visual people? Auditory people? Kinesthetic people? Everyone has a primary learning and interaction style. Knowing your stakeholders’ preferred style puts you in a better position to tailor your message to your audience. 5.\tSpecify the time frame you have for elicitation, according to the company. You may need to collect all the requirements in a short period of time. This constraint means you may need to develop and elicit the requirements in a highly-intensive JAD session (explained in the earlier section Choosing an Approach ). 6.\tExplain the scope of the project. After the project is underway, it should have a clearly defined project scope indicating the boundaries of your project and the objectives to be delivered by the project (much more on this in Chapter 10 ). You don’t want to go outside the boundaries of the scope. Admittedly, moving beyond the project scope helps you understand more about what goes on outside the boundaries of the project at hand, but you only have a limited time with which to focus on the scope of the project. 7.\tBreak down which questions go with which stakeholder. Refer to the earlier section Identifying the type of question you want to ask to determine which questions you ask of each stakeholder. 8.\tWrite out your stakeholders’ schedules and find the time that works best for them; then book your session. Remember to address not only stakeholders’ schedules but also their time zones and when their days start and end. Schedule at a time when stakeholders are going to be at their best. Knowing a particular stakeholder is a “don’t talk to me before I’ve had my morning coffee” kind of person is a great piece of information to have; you don’t ever want to schedule her for a session first thing in the morning, or you may suffer the wrath of an improperly caffeinated stakeholder! When you book your sessions, make sure everyone understands where the session is going to take place and what the objective is. 9.\tIf you’re using applications and tools for elicitation, make sure you pre-trip — or test out — the tool prior to the actual elicitation session. You want to do everything you can to avoid technical problems during the actual elicitation session. 10.\tConduct your elicitation session. Show time: Now you get your hands — er, and also eyes and ears — dirty! Be ready to improvise in your elicitation sessions. Do not go down your list of questions one by one. Your questions are just a starting point; let the conversation flow naturally. You can’t possibly come up with all the questions you need to ask, and some will come out of the sessions, so go with the flow. Your stakeholder may have lots of good information you didn’t plan for. Don’t be overly concerned if all your initial questions aren’t answered. You can always schedule another session to clarify, and some of the information the stakeholders offer may answer some of the future questions you have (and you don’t even have to time-travel).",

        "text": "Chapter 7 Hunting for the Right Information, Part 2: The Techniques In This Chapter Uncovering information by using different elicitation techniques Figuring out which techniques work best given your audience Determining which elicitation techniques work better for different requirements A lthough every BA has his favorite primary elicitation method, all BAs should be comfortable with and adept at all the methods in this chapter. Chances are you’ll need to use more than one technique every time you elicit requirements. Which one(s) you use depends on the size of the group, the company culture, and the types of requirements you need to elicit. Pick the right approaches for the given conditions, and you will successfully glean the info you need to move forward. In this chapter, we detail all 11 techniques, telling you when each technique is most appropriate, how to use it, and more. This information not only forms the foundation of your info-extraction business, but it also is tremendously helpful in the requirements-planning phase (see the details of this phase in Chapter 11 ). Starting with Document Analysis Document analysis is probably your first stop in elicitation. Here, you peruse company documents to glean information about the current environment. Why go off and try and create something new without understanding what the company’s operations are all about? You don’t go into a job interview without understanding the prerequisites and skills needed for the job. You don’t shop for a car without understanding the available options and warranty information. Similarly, you don’t want to start eliciting requirements from stakeholders without understanding more about their current environment. The following sections show you why document analysis is a useful technique and give you a look at the wide variety of documents you may have to work with. Understanding the benefits of document analysis Analyzing existing documentation gives you a good sense of the project; the business processes you’re supporting; and the rules, data, and stakeholders involved. You can get a good return on your investment for your time spent using this technique. Gathering up and reviewing existing documentation also gives you clues as to who needs to be interviewed, data that needs to be captured, business rules that need to be enforced, processes that need to be followed, and that sort of thing. For instance, suppose you’re assigned to a project to create or update some marketing reports. You start by gathering the reports that are currently in production. Here are some things you may notice: The fact that the report can be run for salespeople, sales managers, and division managers: That information tells you that these people need to be included in your elicitation sessions so you can understand their needs. What data the company is currently capturing: That info is important because this data is the information the stakeholders need in order to make decisions. Info that helps you understand the business rules the company enforces: Business rules are guidelines, such as calculations and security clearance levels, that define and shape a company’s business operations and procedures. Consider these rules when defining and designing the solution for your project. You can pull all of this stuff out of the existing reports to create a starting point for developing the right elicitation questions, which helps you create the new report. To perform document analysis, follow these steps: 1.\tGather documentation that has already been created on the business area, systems, and so on, and that is in scope for the project. This documentation may be all over the place — on document collaboration tools, such as Microsoft SharePoint, in servers, and in binders on people’s desks. If you don’t know whether the documentation exists, ask people involved with those systems whether you can find existing documentation. 2.\tRead the documents and take notes. Include in your notes things such as unclear information, glossary terms you need to define, processes that are executed, data involved, and systems and people that interface with the areas under study. 3.\tDevelop in-depth questions for the project team, based on your findings. Examples of such questions include “Do you still pull data from System ABC?”, “Are the stakeholders still located in California?”, and “Does System X still contain the validation routines?” These are the kinds of in-depth questions this approach generates. Perusing examples of documents you can review Documents can be many things in many formats, from actual printed documents to printouts of screenshots to websites and blogs containing company and department information. In the following sections, we explain some of the various kinds of documentation you can review. If a stakeholder pulls a dusty binder off a shelf to get you the documentation you’re after, you may be working with an out-of-date document. (You can also inspect the document for a publication date to be sure.) But old doesn’t necessarily mean worthless. Even if a document is a bit long in the tooth, you can still use it to as historical data and check to see whether the processes and data it mentions are still valid. Reports, letters, and brochures Pick up all reports, letters, or brochures you can get your hands on! Any of these artifacts is a gold mine for understanding how a company implements its processes and enforces policies. Each document holds its own special secrets: Reports: Aside from the actual data contained within it, a report tells you a lot about the audience for the report and the decisions the business makes based on the information. It also shows you how the data is sorted and whether it can be re-sorted. Letters: If you need to understand the various questions a company handles and how it responds to them, look at the letters it produces. Look into the customer service area of a company, for example. Chances are that it has lots of standard letter templates (called boilerplate after an old printing term) it uses to interact with customers. Brochures: Brochures are a great way to understand the products and services a company offers its clients. They also tell you a bit about how the company sees itself — or how it wants to be seen — in the world. When you think of brochures, don’t think only of printed documents. Brochures can also exist electronically on websites. Websites A company’s website can give you an invaluable look inside the organization. Not only do websites typically give you information about location, contact methods, and maybe even merchandise return and service call processes, but they can also tell you a lot about the company’s culture, values, and mission. Spend a lot of time perusing the pages and taking notes: Is the website large or small? Is it text-based or photo-based? Does it seem to make a lot of information available to users, or does it encourage clients to contact the company for more info? What kind of image is the company presenting with its website? Screen layouts You can learn a lot about a company by simply looking at how its program screens are laid out when it performs business operations; truly, screens display lots of data you can use in your analysis. What data do its processes need? Look on the screen. What fields is the user required to fill out? Note those as mandatory fields. How about the labels on the screen? Are they built dynamically (such as to recognize a returning/logged-in user: “Welcome, Paul”)? That’s data. You need to understand where that data is coming from and how the screen builds it dynamically. Also, think about how the screen functions. What happens when buttons are pressed, or how do buttons get enabled? (Think about accepting software terms and conditions — you can’t even enable the software button until you click the “agree to the terms” button.) Screen artifacts can tell you a lot of information, and knowing the current setup — green screens versus GUIs (graphical user interfaces) — can tell you a lot. Be careful, though, of talking too much about the style of the screen too early. You need to understand the data, processes, and people who require access; then you can create a solution, which may be to continue to use the green screen or go over to a graphical interface. In addition to live desktops, you can find screen layouts in tools used to create diagrams, like Microsoft Visio, in simulations, and even hand-drawn on paper or a whiteboard. In the early days of information technology (IT), screen layouts were even drawn on cocktail napkins! Here are a couple of ways to document the key on-screen elements: To document a screen layout, take a screen shot of it by pressing the correct keypad sequence for Print Screen and then save the file. To save a whiteboard drawing of a screen layout, take a picture of the whiteboard; you can even use a smartphone! Forms Forms are very similar to screen layouts, only they’re on paper. If a domain SME (subject matter expert) states that he fills out a form in the operations, ask for a copy of the form; your data elements are right there! Some forms even have boxes showing you how many characters you’re able to capture, so you have a starting point for capturing data field lengths. The forms may indicate which fields need to be completed and which don’t. (For info on SMEs, head to Chapter 3 .) User procedure manuals Business rules — such as how users of a system are supposed to perform a task — are probably contained in the user procedure manuals. By reading these manuals, you can understand how the user should complete a procedure (compare that to observation, which we cover later in the chapter, where you find out how they really do it). For instance, if a procedure manual states that employees, users of the system, may not enroll in the company 401k plan until they have been employed with the company for at least six months, you know that any solution has to enforce this restriction. (Remember: The “user” can be an end customer of the company or the employees of the company, depending on what system you are dealing with.) Looking through user manuals doesn’t highlight only business rules. Business rules require data in order to perform their calculations or enforce their policies, so remember to gather and analyze the data, too. For example, a business rule may be “If you order more than $85 of merchandise, you receive free shipping” — a rule that enforces a company’s free-shipping policy. “Handling equals 15 percent of net purchase amount” is a business rule governing how much a company charges for handling. System documentation (including requirements documents) System documentation, along with system architecture and interface documents, provides a lot of information about how everything works together. This data is especially relevant when it comes to your solution design (refer to Chapter 10 ) because you can easily keep track of which systems your solutions are linked to and then understand the impacts of making changes based on stakeholder requests. The information you get early on in the project helps you as you move through the project and put different solution options on the table. Whether you ask stakeholders for the location of current system documentation or you go off and find it yourself on SharePoint, servers, or in the documentation library, you can discover that an awful lot of information already exists about current projects. Here are some documents containing information for review that you should keep an eye out for on your search: Business requirements document (BRD): This record provides information on what the business needed for the particular system in which the BRD was created. Interface agreements: These documents list the data fields contained in an interface with another system. They also may indicate the valid values used in the interface (for example, the interface may not use all the data fields available). Scope diagrams: These diagrams show which parties and systems are involved in a particular project. System architecture: Use these documents to see how various components of a solution link together to form a complete business system. Functional requirements document (FRD): Also known as a functional requirements specification (FRS), the FRD shows how the business problem was solved. User interface specification: This document shows the screens within the system, including expected actions when users mouse over a field, click on a button, and make selections within a screen. Looking Out for Observation Observation is observing the business doing, well, the business. (Pretty technical, huh?) One goal of observation is to understand how the process is performed, but you can also use this technique to see the business area’s processes, workflow, environmental constraints, and business rules. The bonus? Observation is fairly simple to do and yields a lot of great information that’s tough to get in other ways. In the following sections, we help you decide whether observation is right for your elicitation and break down how to put this approach to work. Knowing when to use observation Observation is an ideal elicitation technique in the following situations: You’re automating a manual process. Observation allows you to understand how the process is performed manually today so you can come up with an automated solution for tomorrow. Be careful that when you create the solution you don’t just “pave the cow path.” By that, we mean that you don’t want to simply put technology on top of a bad process. Doing so only enables businesspeople to perform a bad process even faster. For more information on solutions, head to Chapter 10 . You’re unfamiliar with the business area. By observing, you get to learn and become familiar with the business processes, rules, and data. You want to identify exceptions in the user’s process. Users can describe a process in an interview pretty easily (refer to the later section Conducting Interviews ), but they typically describe the happy path — that is, what happens most of the time if no errors crop up in the process. For instance, if you’re commuting home from work, you normally get in your car and drive home. But what if you get a flat tire? What if your spouse texts you to pick up milk on the way home? What if you run into a ten-mile backup? Observation can help you catch exceptions you’ll need to develop solutions for. You need to capture process metrics. Perhaps the business has no idea how long a process takes. By observing it and timing it, you gain a much better understanding You want to identify process constraints. You may think rolling out laptops to the mobile sales force is a great idea, but then you observe the salespeople’s process and see they have very little time to spend logging on to the laptop between customer visits. Hence, your solution may be a mobile phone app they can more easily access instead. Choosing your observation method and completing the process Even though observation is pretty simple, you can choose from three different approaches to observing a business user in action: Pure observation without interaction: In this model, you simply show up, remain quiet, and watch the person work. Observation with interaction: Here, you do get to interact with the person who performs the job. He can talk to you and you to him as he goes about performing the process you’re observing. This method is a great way to not only ask questions that lead to understanding the process but also to establish rapport with your stakeholders. Performing the task yourself: This method is where you get to perform the job yourself a la the television program Dirty Jobs. With this approach, you establish even more credibility than when you observe with interaction; as an added benefit, you often stumble upon answers to unanswered questions. Here’s a perfect illustration of how valuable performing can be: Paul had a chance to work in a UPS air gateway and sort packages during the big Christmas rush. Before he jumped in to work, he noticed that almost all the sorters were wearing gloves. However, he declined a pair, assuming they were meant to keep the workers’ hands warm; after all, it was December, and the doors to the tarmac were left open. What he didn’t realize was that the gloves had tiny rubber dots on them to assist with the package-gripping activities. After two days of sorting packages bare-handed for hours on end, his hands didn’t work very well. Before performing the process himself, Paul never would’ve thought to ask a question about the gloves, but by experiencing the task first-hand (no pun intended), he gained valuable insight. Observation can not only be used to find out how things work, but it can also be used to confirm other forms of elicitation. By observing, you can see for yourself just how the process is performed in real life. Because this technique can provide so much information, you should strive to integrate different observation techniques into your elicitation to thoroughly capture your information. Ready to get started with observation? Here’s how you do it: 1.\tFigure out when you want to observe. Find out from your stakeholders when the best time to observe this process is. Does the process happen only at a certain time each day? Are there peak times to watch the process? If, for instance, you’re observing the process of traffic management around Los Angeles, watching during rush hour shows you a much different experience than observing Saturday at 3:30 a.m. 2.\tGet permission to observe. Seek permission from the management team before you set up and start watching people. Showing up unannounced can make those you’re observing uncomfortable. Try to put the folks you’re observing at ease. Let them know you aren’t there as a threat but rather to understand their jobs so you can make it easier for them (or whatever the actual reason is). Make sure they know that you want to hear any suggestions they have about the process you’re studying that will make their jobs easier. 3.\tObserve (or better yet, do the job yourself) and make notes. Pay attention to these things: • Process: Note the entire sequence of events that occur, in order, being sure to include quantifiable information (such as how many widgets get pulled from the assembly line because of defects during the given time period or how often the line has to be stopped or slowed because of a glitch). • Business rules: What rules are highlighted during observation. Sticking with the assembly-line example, the business rule would specify how a defect is defined. • External agents: The external agents are the people performing the work. Note who is responsible for each part of the process. • Data: The data is the information used during the process. What information is needed to perform the process, and what data is updated as a result of the process? 4.\tAfter the observation period, use the notes you took in Step 3 to record all your observations. These observations will lead to your understanding of the process and to additional questions surrounding the process. Also keep in mind that something that may seem insignificant in the process (like wearing gloves when sorting packages) can actually turn out to be pretty important. When observing others, you need to realize that people will try hard to not make mistakes or will tend to follow the process as defined — behavior that doesn’t always reflect reality. Suggest to the person you are observing to act as though you are not there. Conducting Interviews Interviews are probably the most-used elicitation technique for a couple of reasons: They’re so easy to do (the BA asks a question, the stakeholder responds), and they can be done any time the BA and a stakeholder get together, whether in person, over the phone, or via e-mail. The following sections walk you through the interview process. Preparing for the interview When preparing for an elicitation interview, think through topics such as the goal of the interview, who your interviewee is and why this matters to him, what type of questions you’re asking him, and what time works best to interview this stakeholder. (Check out Chapter 6 to understand which questions you should direct towards which stakeholders.) Rather than leave scheduling up in the air or fit it in when you can, set up the interview as a meeting, even if it’s a phone call. You want your stakeholders to be able to see it on their calendars to both remind them of the appointment and add legitimacy to the interview. Formal scheduling lets them know you’re taking it seriously and that it’s an important part of the process. Finally, make sure you develop your questions in advance. Although you can let the interview flow along its natural course, you want to have some questions to start with and to go back to, to ensure you’re on track and reaching the goal of the interview. Interviewing the stakeholder If your interviewee isn’t familiar with the project, you may have to give him your elevator speech, a short summary of the project that quickly and simply defines what you’re working on and its value proposition, before you start asking questions. (It’s called an elevator speech because it’s supposed to be succinct enough that you can deliver it to someone as you’re riding in an elevator.) Here are some tips to keep in mind during an interview: Ask open-ended questions (questions that can’t be answered by yes or no). Your goal is to keep the stakeholder talking. Like in a job interview, the interviewee should be doing about 80 percent of the talking. Paraphrase what you hear. This tactic ensures that you not only understand what the stakeholder is saying but also are interested in his situation. Make the session about the stakeholder. Focus on his needs and his problems. Stay away from project-related language as much as possible. The point is that you don’t want to force him to think in terms of what he wants for the project but rather to get him to talk about what his problems are in his business area. Treat the interview like a meeting. If you scheduled 30 minutes, stick to 30 minutes (or less), and use an agenda (remember those questions you prepared ahead of time?). This approach helps keep both of you from straying too far from the topic. At the end, review any action items you recorded during the interview to ensure you both understand what follow-up items need to be addressed. Stakeholders are people, too. Just because you’re conducting a business interview doesn’t mean you can’t make small talk with your interviewee. Establishing a common connection increases your rapport with that stakeholder. Remember: If you are doing more listening and less talking, you are doing a great job. Documenting the interview For maximum results, write up a summary immediately after the interview (because if you’re anything like us, you tend to lose information rapidly as more time elapses from the interview event). Write down the subjects you discussed, the decisions you made, and the action items each of you is responsible for and get the summary to the interviewee. This documentation doesn’t have to be a formal document. Paul uses outlines (in e-mail and in Microsoft Word), a mind-map (a technique to visually outline information discussed briefly in Chapter 4 ), and even Visio drawings as post-interview documentation. (Note, though, that not all stakeholders are familiar with the mind-map technique.) The important thing is getting the information from the interview in front of the stakeholder in the most efficient and effective way. After you’ve compiled and sent the document, have the stakeholder confirm your interview summary. Not only does this move keep the stakeholder involved at this stage, but it also shows that you took the interview seriously and are looking for accuracy (and the stakeholder’s confirmation of that accuracy). This part of the process gives your stakeholder a chance to correct anything in your summary that is incorrect or to clear up any questions you have. Plus, seeing the information again may trigger additional insight or help the stakeholder remember something he didn’t bring up the first time. It’s a way to get him to think about his involvement with the project without having to schedule a follow-up interview. Having the stakeholder confirm the interview summary not only ensures you captured the information correctly but also helps prevent errors. For example, the stakeholder may have misspoken about something; even though you captured his information correctly, the recorded info is still wrong. When the stakeholder sees the summary, he realizes it’s incorrect and makes the correction. Distributing Surveys Most of the time, you can’t fly all around the world to fabulous international destinations to interview all your stakeholders (darn!). So how do you gather information from 4,000 users worldwide? Create a survey (some call it a questionnaire). How do you get them all to respond to the survey? That’s a tougher answer — read on. Dressing for the occasion: Types of surveys Surveys come in two different question type varieties: closed and open-ended. Which type you use depends on the situation: Closed: Using closed questions is perfect when the responses to a question are known and finite. This type is a Yes/No question, pick a choice from a list, or pick all that apply from a list. Closed survey question results are easier to analyze than open-ended results because you can add up the like answers and compare and contrast the totals of each response to determine the requirements for your project. Open-ended: This question type allows for free responses. This type of question is perfect when the responses to the question are not known or the range of responses is large. The responses are more difficult to analyze, but they give you information from respondents in the respondents’ own words. More information may result from this type of question than from closed questions, which allow only for responses that you include. Feel free to combine the types of questions in one survey. You don’t have to have a survey of only closed questions and another for open-ended. Regardless of the question type, think through what the goal of asking the question is and determine the best question type to use. Maximizing the chances of getting a response Be honest: When a website you’re surfing asks you to take a short feedback survey, you usually just close out the window, right? Yet despite the fact that people often ignore survey requests, surveys are a great elicitation technique. Why? Because when done properly, surveys can generate a huge amount of data from a large number of stakeholders. Here are some pointers to help you create a survey that results in a high participation rate: Make the respondents want to participate. Money works, but you don’t always have the luxury to offer cash to pay people to complete your survey. If you can’t offer cash (and who can inside a company?), see whether you can offer the project team that gets the most responses a company-branded shirt, a pizza lunch, or whatever other tangible reward works in the organization’s culture. The point is to figure out what motivator you can offer as the proverbial carrot. If all else fails, you just have to pull the “You have to fill it out because it’s part of the job.” card. Be honest about survey length. Don’t say it’s a 30-second survey if you know it’ll take at least 8 to 10 minutes. Also, don’t say it has 5 questions when each question has so many subquestions that it’s more like a 60-question survey. Use closed-ended questions. Rather than ask for long responses, give yes/no options or a rating scale. This setup is easy for both you and the participant. Surveys yield a lot of data, and you don’t necessarily have time to read all open-ended responses. Weed out participants that don’t fit your demographic upfront. For instance, if you only want people to respond who have dined in a particular restaurant within the last 30 days, ask that question first and then end the survey for anyone who hasn’t dined in. Compiling and using the data After you receive the data, you need to pull it all together. Look for trends in the data and for places where you can exploit opportunities. Examine the data to see what calls out to you as the BA. For information on how to develop the requirements based on the survey results, head to Chapter 12 . Getting to Know Requirements Workshops Requirements workshops, also known as JAD sessions, facilitated workshops, or work sessions, are well-structured, intensive workshops in which an independent facilitator (that would be you) leads participants to develop high-quality work requirements (or products ). The requirements workshop is one of the best techniques to use if you want high-quality requirements in a short amount of time. You can use these workshops at any stage in the project whenever you need to pull in a lot of brainpower from the project team. A little flexibility here, people! Funny story. Paul worked in a company that had a defined elicitation process of creating requirements in structured work sessions. It was so ingrained in the company’s culture that some people were thrown off when Paul tried to understand business needs by sitting in stakeholders’ cubes and asking them questions in a one-on-one session. They couldn’t figure out why his questions couldn’t wait for the work session the next day! In situations like this one, you may have to educate your stakeholders about the value of different ways of elicitation. The products a requirements workshop produces are high quality because many people participate in the session, and the solution comes from the synergy created by everyone working together. ( Synergy is the idea that the sum of everyone’s contribution is greater than any individual part.) Different people bring different suggestions to the table and ask different questions as they come up with solutions. Whether you’re a seasoned pro at facilitating groups and just need to brush up, or someone who is terrified at just the thought of running these sessions, this section of the book is here to help. Identifying participants Requirements workshops can range from one to many hours. You may need multiple sessions over a period of a few days. Because these workshops generally require a significant amount of time, considering who should attend is important. The attendees fall into three categories: Required attendees: These folks are the people who the meeting can’t go on without. If these people don’t show up, the meeting can’t be successful, and you end up with a lot of out-of-meeting tasks. Optional attendees: The meeting can still go on and be successful without these people. However, having them in the session can be helpful because they may bring valuable insight and opinions. Other people: These attendees may be new team members who have just joined the team and are there to listen to how the topic being discussed works. Perhaps you’re cross-training them or interfacing with them from another business domain. Scheduling a workshop When you schedule, you have to look at several factors — the availability of your required attendees, their location, and the length of time you need them. When, where, and for how long you have a workshop depends on knowing this information. Some questions to ask to get the answers include the following: Who are the required attendees, and what is their availability? Where are the attendees located? Are they all in the same building? Different locations? Different time zones? The answers to these questions determine whether you have an in-person or virtual workshop. If attendees are in multiple time zones all over the world, for example, you need to hold a virtual meeting. How long do I make the workshop? This determination depends on how much information you have to cover and on the limitations of stakeholder engagement. If you’re physically in a meeting room together, you can easily monitor the engagement level of the attendees. If you’re holding an online or phone conference, expect that people more easily multitask and may not stay 100 percent engaged. To combat that tendency, keep virtual meeting durations short (one hour or less) so people don’t feel the meeting is taking away from their day; consider using a collaboration tool discussed in Chapter 4 . When planning your workshop, look at people’s calendars and make sure they’re available to attend. State which if any attendees are required. If those people don’t show for the meeting, cancel it; having the meeting without them is a waste of time because you’ll only have to have a second meeting when they do attend. If it becomes common that required attendees do not attend meetings, consider two things. First, ask yourself whether you have the right people identified. Second, determine whether the need to reschedule meetings is putting the project at risk. If the project is at risk, make sure to share that exposure with the team. Managing the session Properly managing a requirements workshop is essential. Info and ideas constantly fly back and forth during workshops, and if you don’t capture them, they disappear. Plus, if you don’t keep the conversation focused on the goal of the session and on the right track, you may not accomplish the elicitation needed for the project. The following sections show you how to keep things moving forward. Using parking lots A parking lot is a list of topics or concerns people bring up in the meeting that you don’t want to address at that moment. Simply add the items as they come up to the parking lot list. This technique has so many advantages it’s not even funny; here are two of the key ones: It shows your concern for the stakeholder’s issue. Most people have a hard time dropping a point when they’re afraid that it’ll be forgotten. By adding it to the parking lot, you allay this fear, enabling the person to move on and not get stuck. It keeps you on track. The concern the stakeholder brings up may be covered later in the agenda, so tabling the point lets you stay on your agenda and not get derailed at that moment. At the end of the meeting, make sure you set aside some time (usually about 5 minutes for a 1-hour meeting) to review the parking lot. At this point, you cover the information, assign it as an action item, or determine whether you need to schedule another meeting to discuss the topic. Before you get to the last option, though, see whether you can assign the concern to a group that can meet separately and provide a resolution. Experiment with using different supplies, such as whiteboards and flip charts, to create your parking lot. You can even find flip chart paper that has adhesive on the back so you can hang everyone’s ideas all around the room! And be prepared: The more organized the session, the more people will take it seriously. Keeping things moving As a BA, you act as a liaison among multiple groups, facilitating the sharing of information and ideas. Think of yourself as a traffic cop responsible for directing the traffic among the groups. If a technical stakeholder asks you a question about a decision the business makes, let the business answer if you don’t know. You don’t have to answer or even try to answer every question. Also consider delegating responsibilities. If you’re running the meeting, consider enlisting the help of another BA to take notes; facilitating the meeting is difficult enough without having to take notes on top of that. At the end of the meeting, the note-taker can turn over the meeting transcript to you so you can summarize the meeting minutes. If you’re using a conference call, consider having the note-taker logged into an instant messenger (IM). This way, if attendees on the conference bridge lose audio connection, they can notify you through IM. When Paul managed a group of BAs, he’d work for his BAs in requirements workshops. The arrangement was that during the meetings, Paul would take notes in an outline, manage the IM traffic (and conversations), and handle the parking lot. The BA facilitating the session could assign Paul a task at any point during the meeting. After the meeting, Paul would turn over the outline to the BA, who would then have a good transcript of the meeting. This arrangement let the BA concentrate on facilitating instead of taking notes. Wrapping things up by assigning action items Before you leave the workshop, make sure you assign action items and agree to a time for their completion. When assigning action items (tasks), follow this advice: Ask the person to take the item. Even though it’s usually clear who needs to take which action item, asking is good etiquette. It also makes good business sense because people are more invested in tasks they agree to than in those foisted on them. Actually asking is one of the best ways to get stakeholder buy-in. Agree to a deadline. Instead of saying “You must complete that by Friday!”, ask the person assigned the task when he can provide the answer. If his answer falls within your preferred time frame, great; you get what you need, and he feels like he’s participated in setting the due date. If he states a date after your deadline, ask why. He may have a very valid reason, and you need to understand that your ideal deadline may not be reasonable. If he doesn’t give a good reason, though, you need to explain why you need the information on a particular date. Sometimes further explanation is all that’s necessary to get the stakeholder to agree to your deadline. If for whatever reason the date can’t be met by the person, consider reassigning the task to another team member to keep the project moving forward. After the meeting, distribute the meeting minutes to the meeting attendees (and anyone else who asks to be informed) so they can confirm the discussion and especially the key decisions affecting the direction of the project). Good practice is to distribute the meeting minutes within 48 hours of the requirements workshop. Brainstorming Brainstorming is a technique you can use to generate a large number of ideas in a short period of time. In brainstorming, you present a question, dilemma, issue, or whatever you’re gathering info for and have participants voice their ideas without censure or modification. Brainstorming works by sparking new ideas as everyone hears everyone else’s contributions. The result is synergy, and it’s awesome. When conducting a brainstorming session, make sure you and your participants follow these rules: Let the ideas flow creatively and encourage the same from the session participants. When looking at other people’s responses, speak out what comes into your mind, no matter how crazy it may sound. If you hear or see something that reminds you of something else, it’s your duty to share it! Your creative thought may spark someone else’s creative thought. Don’t shut down any ideas. No idea is a bad idea — not yet, at least. If you start saying, “We can’t possibly implement that!”, you run the risk of stunting the session. Participants may stop being so free with their ideas if they think they’ll just get shot down. Yes, some of the ideas may be crossed off the list eventually, but they must be on the list to be crossed off. A related concept is to praise ideas to encourage continued participation. Use it judiciously, though; praising may cause people to stop being creative and start trying to think of similar ideas to get the same praise. Don’t criticize or edit rules. Just because someone decides mid-session that he doesn’t like the rules doesn’t mean he can change them or criticize them. This isn’t a playground; you can’t take your ball and go home. Build on others’ ideas and have participants do the same. If nothing is sparking you, and you feel as though you’re left behind, read through the list of brainstormed ideas again. If some people aren’t participating, ask them questions like, “Jeff, what do you think about the situation?” The important thing is to bring stragglers into the discussion. To help everyone feel comfortable with sharing ideas, start the session off with all participants writing their ideas down independently. Then open the session up by having them verbally share ideas. At the end, ask the participants to check their lists and see whether any additional items can be added. Considering Focus Groups If an elicitation technique was ever a top choice for the retail business domain, focus groups would likely be it. A retail operation’s business structure is built on needing to solicit opinions from external customers, and focus groups do just that. Focus groups are sessions designed to elicit opinions on products from randomly selected individuals representing a particular demographic or viewpoint. When creating a focus group, consider the following points: Figure out the topic you want to cover. Doing so helps you figure out who you want to pull into the focus group. For instance, if you’re eliciting people’s attitudes and opinions about diapers, you probably want to involve parents of young children (and specifically, the parents that change the diapers). Consider holding the session off-site. By scheduling the focus groups away from corporate headquarters, you accomplish two things: • Helping participants feel more at ease: The idea of having the corporate big brother looking over their shoulders may make people feel inclined to sugar-coat their opinions or to hold back. • Maintaining the company’s anonymity: You may not want the people in the focus group to know whose product you’re evaluating. This strategy helps keep a company’s direction a secret. If people in the focus group are talking about the company’s product, they could leak information about it that you don’t want the general public to know. Have an independent facilitator monitor. These people are trained to be impartial and to drill into the information you need to get, so use them. If the facilitator isn’t independent, he may goad or push the attendees into a direction that supports a company’s hypothesis. If your facilitator is a BA assigned to Project X, and the members of the focus group are condemning the Project X application, the facilitator may feel inclined to start defending it. Engage the members of the group. Ask them for suggestions on what they think would be a great solution. Although you may not use exactly what they suggest, they may give you a solution or something that sparks a solution. Doing Interface Analysis If you think interface analysis is the act of analyzing the interfaces, you can go to the head of the class. But realize that you’re dealing with more than just the user interfaces. An interface is a connection that your project (or application) has with a user, another computer system, or a piece of hardware. You most often use this elicitation technique with software solutions because understanding the number of interfaces the project interacts with is critically important. With this knowledge, you can present your project estimate with facts rather than a guesstimate like “small,” “medium,” or “large.” Using interface analysis, you have an artifact showing the number of interfaces. When performing this technique, mine the documents (flip to the earlier section Document Analysis for the lowdown on document analysis) to look at the impacts (what other areas, applications, systems, people, hardware, and other projects it interacts with; if the interface is a connection between the solution for your project and something else, the impact is what needs to be done in order to interface properly with that the something else). For instance, look at Figure 7-1 to see how creating an application needs to find all the interfaces. In this figure, the stakeholders have identified three interfaces for a maps application: User Interface (the people who need to interact with the information and application), System Interfaces (the GPS satellites, which makes it possible to get position), and a Hardware Interface (which enables the user to charge the device. Think about the interfaces Apple had to deal with for just one app in the iOS 6 upgrade. The maps application had to have a new user interface, a system interface with the mapping services, and a hardware interface to the new iPhone. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 7-1: Example of interface types. As the BA, you need to think about these interfaces because even a seemingly small request from a stakeholder can turn into a much larger project. The more interfaces there are, the more people you have to work with to make sure the interface is working as needed. Here are some questions to ask to find interfaces and help you determine the extent of the impact: Where does the information we need come from? Where is the information sent? How do we move the information from system to system (hardware interfaces)? Who uses the system? What kind of user? What kind of experience level? Prototyping In prototyping, you create a model of the proposed solution. In business analysis, a prototype, or mockup, generally means a representation of a computer screen and examples of how the user will interact with the application to accomplish a task to solve the business problem. The BA creates the prototype, usually with help from the technical team. Prototyping is a great tool to communicate what a software solution will look like. You just need to make sure that the solution doesn’t come before the underlying problem has been identified. Sometimes, a stakeholder draws a picture showing you what he thinks the solution should look like. That initiative isn’t necessarily bad, but it puts the cart before the horse. In this situation, you still need to understand what the underlying problem is within the business domain. Here are the reasons why prototyping is so great: Prototypes give users something tangible to review. People are visual. Many people are interested in seeing what something looks like, and the prototype fits this bill. When done properly, prototypes can speed up the project lifecycle. If a picture is worth a thousand words, prototypes save a lot of talking. In fact, in a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system, BAs often start with prototypes because the screen has already been designed. The changes to the screen and the configuration will be modified on the mockup. Be careful about using prototypes too early in the project. Users may get caught up in the aesthetics of the screen and want you to make the fonts sans serif or something like that. Unless someone presents a valid reason for changing the aesthetics, remember the purpose of the prototype: You’re only trying to understand how the solution should function. In addition, make sure everyone knows the prototype is just a picture. Some prototypes may look, and even feel, like a real system. People tend to think the system is already built and ready to be used, but it hasn’t. That said, sometimes aesthetic changes matter. Paul once created a dashboard for his manager that showed the health of the manager’s projects with green, yellow, and red boxes. Unfortunately, the manager was colorblind, so the red and green boxes weren’t useful. That is a valid reason to change colors! You can work with three different types of prototypes, which we explain in the next sections. Throwaway prototypes You may be shocked that we’d suggest you throw away something you took a long time creating, but that’s essentially what you do with throwaway prototypes. Throwaway prototypes are just pictures. You may draw them on a whiteboard or with an application like Microsoft Word or even on a napkin. These may be kept as artifacts, but they are thrown away in the sense that they are not used to build the system directly. Sure, they’re useful graphics, but that’s the extent of it. The development team starts to build or update the application from scratch because the prototype can’t be leveraged (it doesn’t include code that developers can use when programming the solution). Figure 7-2 shows an example of a throwaway prototype for a computer application. What’s hard to notice is that it’s just a drawing. Nothing more. That means the developers have to start coding from scratch. Illustration by Wiley, Composition Services Graphics Figure 7-2: A throwaway prototype. When you make throwaway prototypes, follow the concept of “just enough.” That is, spend only enough time on the prototype to get the project team to understand what needs to be done, and then move on. Time is tight, so you don’t want to spend any longer than is necessary. Evolutionary prototype Evolutionary prototypes let the development team leverage the effort of the analysis; basically, what starts as a prototype turns into the actual solution. The advantage with this approach is that the expectations from the business are solid. They see the actual front end of the solution, and the developers make the necessary changes as the team works to clearly define the solution. Many times, the development team is involved in the creation of the front end and can guide the team on approaches. Simulation prototype Simulation prototypes are sort of like throwaway prototypes on steroids. Ultimately, the development team can’t leverage these prototypes for code (although at the time of this writing, some simulation tools are allowing some code snippets to be exported like in an evolutionary prototype). The advantage with the simulation is it gives the business stakeholders something tangible to walk through. Users can interact with the solution and see how it works as they click and navigate through the proposed solution. There is discussion about simulation tools in Chapter 4 . Reverse Engineering Reverse engineering refers to looking at the solution to figure out how it works. Basically, you work backward from the solution to understand the data, processes, and business rules. Reverse engineering is more common than you think. Have you ever looked into a Microsoft Excel formula to figure out where it’s coming up with the calculation? Congratulations; you’ve reverse engineered! Usually, reverse engineering is used to examine software or software components to figure out how they’re processing business rules, where they’re sourcing data, and how they make decisions. Basically, you want to understand how the software is supporting the business. The use of this elicitation technique is increasing across the field because of all the legacy systems (old computer systems) sitting around. These systems need to be updated or replaced completely. Applications built on the mainframe 30 years ago were never expected to last as long as they have, and technology has progressed so far that these systems have to be reverse engineered so people can figure out how they work. Here are some more-specific situations in which reverse engineering can be helpful: When you’re not sure what is happening within your code or need to understand how an old computer system calculates a certain field: Business users may ask about how the system supports the business process, or what business rules are being enforced, which means you have to go in and figure it out. When the software documentation is out of date: In fact, you may not even have any documentation. Without up-to-date documentation on how the software works, you may have to go into a system and trace the code logic to find out why, say, the system performs a calculation a certain way. When business users aren’t aware of the business rules being enforced: The business may have changed in the years since the rules were hard-coded into the application. You may have to walk business users through the system to find out what rules are being enforced and how they need to be changed. When you’re interfacing systems and need to know the correctness of data in each system: This challenge is one you face when you create ongoing interfaces or one-time data migrations. For instance, in order to comply with e-mail regulations, you need to make sure opt-out preferences are always correct. If you do a migration, you need to go back and double-check that the old and new settings match. Don’t hesitate to ask for help with reverse engineering. If you don’t understand where or how to look through software code, enlist a developer on the project team. He will have a good idea where to start looking for the rules, data, or enforced processes. Choosing Competitive Analysis Competitive analysis is a technique to examine your competitor’s products and services and evaluate them against your products and services. The result is seeing how your offering stacks up against the competition. The thought behind this technique is that external customers will not accept or adopt your product if it doesn’t offer at least the minimum number of features and functions that your competitor’s product offers. If a competitor’s Product B has features X, Y, and Z for $199, and you roll out a similar Product B that has only feature X but is the same price, how often do you think consumers will buy your product? Think about companies in the mobile phone industry. They’re always looking to see what features and functions their competitors are offering so that they can offer more features or a better way to accomplish the same feature for a similar or lower price. The BA performs the competitive analysis and then presents it to the project team, perhaps in a comparison table (our product versus their product) or a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. When performing competitive analysis, think through the following questions: What features does our competitor have on a similar product? What are the most important features to customers, and how does our product stack up against the competition based on those features? Hint: Use focus groups, which we discuss earlier in the chapter, to understand what the external consumer really cares about. Can we exploit our competition’s lack of features we already have or develop features neither of us has? How can we position our features/functions in a way that puts our product in a better light? When performing competitive analysis, make sure you aren’t your own competitor. If you offer a lower-priced product that has almost the same functionality as one of your premium (higher-priced) products, you may be stripping away sales from the premium product, essentially competing against yourself.",

        "text": "Foreword Michael Shares His Wealth In today’s “What’s in it for me right now?” world, Michael Aun stands as a successful person who recognizes that “right now” is not as powerful as “day-by-day.” Consistency wins the race. And consistency is only one of Michael’s success attributes. Family man, high ethics, and dogmatic to achieve and be positive from the first minute of the morning until his head hits the pillow at night, are some others. His engaging online publication, “Behind the Mike,” is a misnomer. Michael Aun is always out in front. It’s the reason he has achieved so much in his career, and it’s the reason he will continue to achieve. I always read it from beginning to end. It’s loaded with insight, humor, and wisdom. In this book, It’s the Customer, Stupid! , Michael goes to great lengths to explain the validity and the monetary value of customers, repeat customers, loyal customers, and referred customers. Because everyone is looking to make sales, build business, increase profits, and become successful now , this book addresses the gold in your own backyard that you are not mining. Your customers. Better stated, your loyal customers. Michael has succeeded in the insurance business, which in my opinion is the most difficult business to achieve over the long term. In a market segment where no one wants to meet with the seller, Michael was always able to meet with the buyer, and he didn’t just make sales, he established relationships and over the years has kept a fiercely loyal customer base. Not just renewals, but also referrals. In this book Michael explains the why, the how, and the how much. Think about your own customer base or your own client base. How do they feel about you? How do they talk about you? What do they mean to you? (But more important, what do you mean to them?) How valuable are you? How believable are you? How available are you? And how trustworthy are you perceived to be? All of these qualities ensure success, but not one without the other. And all of these qualities are Michael Aun qualities. Everyone—including you—is looking for today’s answers. An idea, a direction, a plan. This book is loaded with them. He’s not saying, “Go back to basics.” He’s saying, “Here are the fundamentals. Here’s how I handled them, here’s how I mastered them, and here’s what you need to do. Now!” We’re living in a time of doubt, a time of uncertainty, and a time of distrust. This book provides a road map for gaining these critical fundamental attributes while others are losing them. NOTE WELL: As you read this book you would be well advised to grab a highlighter, read slowly, and make notes in the margins. And if you are persistent enough, and consistent enough, to turn those notes into actions, then you will have maximized the value of this book. It’s funny, when I first saw the title of this book, I immediately thought about how many companies I have talked to, and how many people, especially salespeople and service people, I have spoken with. When they talk about customers they say, “It’s the stupid customer!” Blaming is so easy in this world at this time. Taking responsibility is so much harder. But believe it or not it’s safer, and more rewarding, for both the customer and for you. Everyone has an idea, philosophy, or strategy about what customers are all about. Michael Aun has a passion for what customers are all about. And as you look through the table of contents you will find that he also has an understanding of what customers are all about. It is from his lifetime of experience that you will gain new insights about the critical customer service topics in today’s markets, including word-of-mouth marketing, word-of-mouth advertising, finding out what the customer really thinks, giving the customer more than they were expecting, having a service heart, problem resolution, and the all-important skills of communication. As a high-level Toastmaster, Michael has mastered the art and the science of communicating to a group and an individual, as husband and wife or a thousand husbands and wives. This book also tackles the sensitive subjects of taking responsibility, advocacy, time management, speed of response, and bad news. The cool part about bad news is that Michael shows you how to turn it into great news and provides insight that will help you understand how bad news occurs, how fast it travels, and the magic of converting it to good news. As if all this weren’t enough, there is the sensitive topic of results (or should I say measuring results). Michael’s leadership both demands results and commands results. Michael’s style and leadership ensure results and do it using the voice of his customer, included with his own it is those collaborative qualities. He doesn’t “have” customers; he has fiercely loyal customers. They are an integral part of his success and Michael shows you how to make them an integral part of yours. This book delivers Michael’s experience as a salesman, a manager, a speaker, a businessman, a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a person of character. It’s authentic. And Michael’s authenticity is transferable—to you. I’ve known Michael for nearly 20 years. We are fellow members of the National Speakers Association Hall of Fame. In fact, he was the one who nominated me. In order to respect someone’s words and honor someone’s deeds, you have to respect the person, and Michael Aun is the shining example of what to do in business, in family, and in life.

        "text": "Acknowledgments Special thanks have to be given to Toastmasters International and my local Osceola Club 1841 in Kissimmee, Florida, and especially Nancy Street, who helped edit this manuscript. Without Toastmasters, my entire business and speaking career would not have been possible. I want to thank my family as well. My late parents, Alice and Michael Aun, brought 11 children into this world and nurtured them with good habits and discipline. Any success I have enjoyed in my life is a by-product of their love, care, and encouragement. I want to thank the most incredible salespeople on the planet, my extraordinary granddaughters, Ashley and Ava, who are only four and two at the time this goes to press. They are the greatest salespeople I have ever known, masterful at asking questions and never taking “no” for answer. Neither have a clue what the word “no” means. They do understand the power of “why?” The most important people in my life are my wife, Christine, and our three sons, Cory, Jason, and Christopher. I learned many great principles from my amazing sons. The students became the teachers. Jason, who is a microbiologist, taught me the incredible power of self-discipline as he and his twin brother, Cory, became national champion weightlifters. Cory taught me the importance of being a mentor and coach for other people. He is an astonishing athletic coach and teacher of biology and the sciences. He brings fun and education into his classroom and onto the playing fields, helping children to love the sciences and athletics. His fellow coaches and teachers as well as his students and athletes sing his praises, which is a powerful customer service testimonial. My youngest son, Christopher, taught me the noteworthy gift of “giving” by providing care for others. Like his mother, he is a registered nurse. The nature of that profession is the greatest testimonial to customer service that exists. He inspires me with the good work he and other medical professionals do every day. I am also moved by the good works done by the medical staff of the St. Thomas Aquinas Free Medical Clinic in my church in St. Cloud, Florida. The 75 doctors and 150 nurses and other volunteers donate their time, talent, and treasure so that the poor can have health care; that is truly a remarkable tribute to what servant leadership is all about. Finally and most importantly, I want to thank the most important person in my life, my wonderful wife, Christine. She has taught me how to love and care for others though it might not always be easy to do so. She always admonishes me to “Be nice and everything else takes care of itself.” She never had one day of customer service training, but in my mind, she knows more about caring for a customer than any person I have ever met. She is the true motivation for It’s the Customer, Stupid! and is the reason for any success it will enjoy. I love her more than life itself. God bless all who have touched my life to make this book possible.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 1 Unhappy Customers Will Not Only Fire You but They Will Tell Others! Dissatisfied customers tell an average of 10 other people about their bad experience. Twelve percent tell up to 20 people. Every company on the planet talks about rendering dynamite customer service. Some like to refer to their customer service departments as “Customer Care Centers.” Ironically, however, the cuffs often don’t match the collar. Although these organizations espouse the great respect they have for their clients, they build multiple walls around the company to prevent these very customers from getting a fair shake. While I’m amazed by the hypocritical attitude that seems to pervade much of the corporate world today, I’m not surprised when corporate culture asks customers: “What have you done for me lately?” Their mission statement espouses one thing; their actual mission does quite another. The term “customer satisfaction” may be too subjective and impossible to define. Why? As it is with beauty, it is defined by the buyer, not the seller. Indeed, most corporate cultures couldn’t care less what their buyers think. After all, just look at the way they treat them. First, they assume that most customers are trying to find “something for nothing.” Second, they make the client wait on hold for unreasonable periods of time before grandly coming on the phone line to ask how they can “be of help.” Third, they build impossible barriers that the client is forced to navigate to garner any “satisfaction.” Finally, the client must play by their rules to get any kind of results. No wonder clients are wary of the empty promise of “customer satisfaction.” The fact is that keeping customers “satisfied” simply isn’t enough anymore. In fact, if they’re merely satisfied, they often don’t bother to come back—because they don’t like the rules by which they had to play in order to attain this “satisfaction.” And if this is the sorry way most satisfied customers treat you, imagine how ticked off the genuinely dissatisfied customer is. The unhappy customer will tell an average of 10 other people about their bad experience. Twelve percent will tell up to 20 people. To that end, it’s not enough to simply satisfy a customer anymore. Satisfaction is a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10—and it simply won’t do. You have to promise a lot nowadays, but you have to deliver more. And whatever you do promise, you must absolutely deliver. Case in point: There is a Domino’s Pizza vendor in south Detroit who receives the same phone call every Thursday afternoon from someone ordering a hamburger, mushroom, and onion pizza at 4:30 pm By 5:00 pm or thereabouts, Domino’s delivers the pizza. At 5:30 pm the same customer calls back and complains that he was unhappy with the pizza, and before 6:00 pm on Thursday afternoon of each week, Domino’s refunds this customer his money. To be fair, the customer is simply taking advantage of the Domino’s promise. But Domino’s made the promise. In fact, Domino’s built its entire company on a promise. In the early days, if they failed to deliver within 30 minutes, you got the pizza for free. Then a huge lawsuit ensued that prompted the chain to alter its promise. However, Domino’s still stands by its product today—and if you don’t like it, you don’t pay. I asked a Domino’s vendor once what this promise cost his shop over the course of a year. “Maybe around $200,” he replied. “[But] the well-publicized stories [on the company] done by 60 Minutes and other [television shows] . . . have been estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars in free advertising.” Keeping customers happy pays dividends. It is the customer’s opinion of the bad news, stupid—and it travels faster today than ever before. Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Unhappy customers will fire you on the spot because they now have options that will only increase. 2. They won’t just fire you; unhappy clients will personally tell up to 10 people about their bad experience. Twelve percent will tell 20 people.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 2 Great Customer Service Is About Getting the Client’s Feedback Happy customers will tell an average of five people about their positive experience. I’m blessed to be married to the most patient person in the world. My wife, Christine, is the perfect customer. She genuinely feels that the company always deserves the benefit of the doubt and goes to great pains to give them the opportunity to fix a problem when one exists. Christine patiently navigates her way through the corporate maze that companies construct to render achieving customer satisfaction something of an oxymoron for most of us mere mortals. And when she finally gets what she was after, she’s so appreciative that she writes glowing testimonials to the same people who gave her the third degree to get there—all for doing simply what they are supposed to do. After all, she’s a customer; she paid for the product or service. I, on the other hand, have a short fuse. I want what I paid for from the beginning and I don’t want to beg. In fact, the title of my most popular keynote address on customer service is “Have I Gotta Beg to Buy?” Laugh at it if you will, but the fact is most customers feel this way about the whole buying process. They’d rather milk a cobra than wander through this maze. I’ve spoken on this topic at least 75 to 100 times a year for almost four decades, and nearly every single presentation is different. I do up to 50 hours of interviews with every client to find out what they think the issues are. Ironically, the most revealing interviews come from the client’s own customer, whom I also interview. Mind you, I go into those interviews knowing that they are going to steer me toward a happy customer who is an ongoing client. Even the happy ones have a laundry list of things they were expecting but did not receive. Though one might wonder why this is, the answer is probably simpler than you think. Maybe, just maybe, the folks charged with the responsibility of sales, marketing, and customer service weren’t trained any better, or maybe they weren’t selected properly. You can hire an idiot and “train” him or her, but all you end up with is a well-trained idiot. The fault may well lie in many different areas of the process. Take a Lesson from Milliken & Company In my opinion, the greatest company on the planet is textile giant Milliken & Company, based out of Spartanburg, South Carolina. Since winning the World Championship of Public Speaking for Toastmasters in 1978, I have had the privilege of addressing thousands of audiences in some 22 countries throughout the world. Milliken is my favorite group because they think differently—which makes them a champion in the textile business. Milliken provides better customer service than any company I know of for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, they require all employees to complete 40 hours of continuing education per year, just to keep their jobs. The company pays for their employees’ courses and offers a variety of choices from Toastmasters to their famous POE weekends, an acronym for Pursuit of Excellence. For years, I had the opportunity to address dozens of Milliken’s POE conferences throughout the Carolinas and Georgia, working alongside speaking giants Tom Peters and others. Great Customer Service Is About Great Training According to industry standards, Milliken is not the highest paid workforce in the textile industry. However, some would argue that they are the best trained in the world. Milliken believes you have to teach people to think differently and creatively. Their mantra is simple: To do it better, you have to do it differently. When I was first introduced to Milliken, I learned of their now-renowned ECR Program, another of their famous acronyms, which stands for Error Cause Removal . Unlike most of their peers, Milliken encourages creative thinking—and they back it up with cash. Milliken managers prowl the floors of their plants, encouraging their employees to find a better way to do a project. Any new ideas that employees imagine do not go into a suggestion box to be opened three years later. Rather, employees are encouraged to step up and voice their ideas on the spot. Ideas that have merit are implemented immediately. The employee receives a cash bonus that the manager has been empowered to reward. The net result is that Milliken has one of the most innovative workforces in the worldwide textile corridor, with employees who are the envy of the international textile community. You Get the Behavior You Reward Milliken realizes an important trend: You get the behavior you reward. The longer it takes to recognize good habits, the less likely employees are to engage in them. During my career as a motivational speaker, I have learned three incontrovertible facts about motivation: 1. You cannot motivate anybody to do anything they do not want to do. Motivation is internal, not external. It comes from within. 2. All people are motivated to do something. Even the person who stays in bed in the morning rather than going to work is more motivated to sleep. They might be negatively motivated, but they are motivated nevertheless. 3. People do things for their reasons, not anyone else’s. The trick is to find out what their reasons are—which you can do by encouraging creative thinking and rewarding all ideas, no matter how silly they might appear—and by asking the “who, what, when, where, why, and how” questions that managers so rarely ask. The ECR Program was implemented based on Milliken’s belief that rewards will encourage innovative thinking among their staff members. ECR was designed to reduce or remove margins for error. The net result of the program is that it has saved Milliken millions of dollars over the years, and not just because they caught a mistake here or found a better way to do something there. It therefore stands to reason that because this program worked so well for Milliken’s internal customers—their employees—then it should apply to the external customer—the end user of the Milliken product. To that end, this imaginative and resourceful company—which battles foreign labor forces that pay their employees pennies per hour—took its idea of “continuing education” to one of their biggest clients: the Chrysler Corporation. Chrysler buys fabric from Milliken that ultimately becomes the bucket seat cover in their automobiles. That fabric is produced in the form of reams of material that are shaped roughly like a rectangle. That material is ultimately cut and trimmed to become a seat cover in a Chrysler automobile—ultimately shaped like an oval. Great Client Feedback Will Help Dictate Great Customer Service, if You Bother to Listen! Milliken brought Chrysler engineers into their Spartanburg, South Carolina, customer training facility and essentially challenged them to provide their feedback on the product. “Tell us how we can do our job better in order to serve you better,” Milliken requested. “We want to teach you how to be a better customer by having you show us how we can produce a more valuable product.” Frankly, no one had ever spoken to Chrysler’s buyers this way. This was totally innovative and creative thinking: actually asking the customer what they wanted and then giving it to them. Chrysler responded by saying, “Okay, Milliken; here you go. If we could get this material from you shaped originally like an oval—the shape that we ultimately cut it to be—then it would save our engineers 19 percent to 21 percent in labor costs.” The cost of trimming the product, perforating it, and then producing it into a bucket seat was costing Chrysler a significant amount of time and money. Trimming the product before it left the Milliken plant immediately saved this time and money—thereby making Chrysler a much happier customer. The program was working; all Chrysler had to do was cut the oval in half and produce a bucket seat. However, this solution left Milliken with an interesting dilemma of their own: What were they going to do with the “floss” in between the teeth of the bucket seat covers? They came up with an innovative and profitable solution: to turn the extra material into rags. Milliken entered a $50 million per year rag industry, simply by listening to the customer. It was a situation in which both the customer and the vendor win. Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Work with your customers to come up with creative solutions together . Ask them outright how your products could be better or more helpful. 2. Always communicate. Nothing makes an unhappy customer angrier than someone who won’t respond to their problem.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 3 Fix the Problem; Don’t Fix the Blame It costs 5 to 15 times more money to attract a new customer than to keep an existing one. When I lived in South Carolina, I had to find a new grocery store when my uncles retired and closed our family business—Mack’s Cash and Carry grocery. The store I selected shall go unnamed but it appropriately rhymes with the word “ogre.” In those days, I would pile my twin sons into my old pickup truck, and we would head into town to grocery shop. We usually bought a minimum of three shopping carts full of groceries so that we only had to make the trip a couple times per month. We didn’t shop so much as we swooped, pouncing on dozens of cans of such delectable items as SpaghettiOs, a primary menu item in a house with small kids. Since grocery shopping was right up there with chewing tinfoil for me, it was never a truly enjoyable experience. However, one particular afternoon turned out to be worse than the others. My sons and I had just run up a $450 tab and were checking out our three shopping carts of groceries. I got home, started unloading, and realized I was missing a six-pack of Diet Pepsi drinks. I called the store that rhymes with “ogre” and got the manager. I explained my dilemma. He placed me “on hold” and disappeared for five minutes while he checked with the irrefutable fountain of knowledge (the bag boy) who testified that he indeed saw “the fat guy” drive out with the six-pack of drinks in the back of his pickup. Stop the Frame Let’s stop the frame for a moment. If I were going to try to rip off “ogre,” wouldn’t I have gone for the filet steaks? Why pick a $1.79 six-pack of cola? Long story short—the manager came back on and let me know that “The bag boy says you got your drinks, Bub.” “Bub” is a name to which I don’t normally answer. “Bubba,” perhaps—but never “Bub.” Clearly frustrated with this response, I called his boss the next day and explained my problem. His superior understood those old customer service rules, of which there are only two: (1) The customer is always right. (2) See rule number one. It isn’t rocket science. “Sorry that happened,” he explained. “I’ll tell the store to give you a six-pack next time you’re in.” Now, it just so happened that I was speaking to an “ogre” convention in French Lick, Indiana, the next week. During my speech, I touted the Lexington, South Carolina store’s ability to fix my problem and provide quality customer service. It was a terrific war story that I may have even embellished a bit. Knowing that my diet drinks would be awaiting me when I returned the store, I made their company look like heroes. Two weeks later the check from “ogre” had cleared, and we were in the store, swooping again. This time I’m checking out some $650 of groceries (yes—we eat a lot). I went to my favorite checkout lady—a neighbor of ours—and explained the diet drink situation. “Yeah, I heard about that,” she replied. Then she said something that concerned me: “Let me go check with the manager.” The manager came down from on high. (They always hide out in those glass booths with one-way mirrors to see who is stealing candy and such.) His opening statement, in front of six lanes of traffic, was: “Yeah, I remember you. You’re the guy who tried to rip off a six-pack of drinks last time you were in here.” My priest, checking groceries one lane over, looked up at me as if to say, “You didn’t bring that up in confession last week!” Obviously, the manager had not gotten the message from his boss about replacing my drinks. So I suggested that he call his superior and get this straight once and for all. He was screwing up the terrific story that I had told the French Lick group two weeks prior. “I’m not bothering my manager at this hour of the day.” “It’s only 5:00 pm,” I said. “He’s probably not even home yet.” “I’m not bothering him with this nonsense. If you don’t like our service, you can shop somewhere else.” Deflated and beaten down, I got home that evening and hit the button on Quicken to see what we had spent on groceries that year. It was over 10 grand—which blew my mind, because it was only August. There were still four and a half more months of grocery shopping (and the months that included “holiday eating,” no less.) The Cost of Lost Opportunity It’s been said that every customer you anger costs you 10 to 15 times the amount of money to replace. Losing my business had cost “ogre” over $100,000 because I have never shopped there again—not to mention the fact that I speak a hundred times a year on customer service, and now had a great example of what not to do. In fact, I was sharing this story with an audience of newspaper publishers later that year in Orlando when a prominent national journal decided to write it up as a feature column. The day after the column appeared, I showed up at my office to find six cases of every kind of diet drink that has ever been created sitting on the front steps—along with a note of apology. But it was too little, too late. “Customer service” shouldn’t be the oxymoron that this company had made it. Ninety Percent of Customers Make Decisions Based on Service With every survey today shouting the statistic that 90 percent of customers make their decisions on where to do business based on the service they receive, you had better be paying attention. You have to wonder if the inmates are in charge of the asylum, since companies are spending billions of dollars a year on correcting a problem that should never have occurred to begin with. Our latest unscientific research suggests that the average amount of money spent on customer service training in the United States today is less than $5 per year per employee, and is nonexistent in many companies. This isn’t employees’ fault; they simply aren’t trained correctly—if at all—and often aren’t empowered to fix customer issues. And with more and more business being outsourced to other countries, the problem is only getting worse. Recently, my brand-new fax machine died. After having to replace ink cartridges on what seemed like a daily basis, it decided one day to simply stop accepting the new cartridges at all. No problem, I thought; I hauled it down to Staples, where I purchased it, and they attempted to install a new cartridge. They got the same results. The folks at Staples were kind enough to provide me with a toll-free number, which I used to call the fax maker to make good on the warranty I had for the defective equipment. And while it turns out that they were more than willing to replace the machine, I had to jump through an amazing number of hoops to get it done. Someone who identified himself as Michael answered my first call. He was located in India, which was the first problem. I had to try to reach him at a time that was convenient for him, not me. Since no one answers their phone anymore—you leave a voice mail and they call you back at their convenience, not yours—I attempted to get in touch during nontraditional business hours (read: middle of the night). However, I’m a trooper. I stuck with it, determined to get a response. Unfortunately, when I finally got Michael on the phone, I literally could not understand a word he was saying. After asking him to repeat himself several times, we both concluded that he could not solve the problem and the machine was junk. An hour of back and forth led to the decision that he would have the machine replaced—but only under certain rules and conditions. First, he would send me a voucher that I could use to redeem the cost of a new machine. Secondly, I could not get the machine from Staples, the supplier from whom I had made the original purchase. I had to go through the manufacturer’s web site. In the end, it took the company four days to send me the e-mail voucher. Since they were unwilling to pay for next-day shipping, I was going to be without a machine for another week. I finally gave up, returned to Staples, and bought a new machine—made by the original company’s chief competitor. I will never purchase anything from this major supplier ever again. Yes, they did make good on their defective equipment; but they made the entire process so very unpleasant and difficult that we simply abandoned doing business with them. Granted, I’m just one guy—a blip on their radar. However, this particular guy speaks to over 100 audiences per year, composed of thousands of attendees. So I’m one guy who becomes many. When I pointed this out to Michael in India, he was perplexed—and I do not really blame him. Despite the fact that he worked for a major global company, he was not empowered to solve my problem. It was obvious that they had an interest in making their warranty good, but under rules and conditions that I simply could not tolerate. It was easier and cheaper for me to buy a new machine. They have lost my business and will never know it unless poor Michael in India shares my ranting and raving with his superiors. Why Not Empower the Customer Service Rep? My question is simple: Since you gave Michael permission to make good on your defective equipment, why didn’t you also give him a way to do so without forcing me to jump through a bunch of unnecessary hoops? All he would have had to do was send me the voucher via e-mail that same day, and allow me to use it at Staples immediately. I would have been a loyal customer for life because I was back in business again. Instead, they got greedy and forced me to bypass Staples. The folks at Staples were beside themselves. They wanted to simply give me a new machine and replace it with the one the supplier was going to ship. It was not Staples’ problem; it was the fax maker’s. So I rewarded Staples by buying a better machine at a higher price and I now have a wonderful war story to scream from 100 platforms across the world each year. The Cost of Making the Client’s Life Difficult What is the true cost to this company? It is difficult to say. How many other small businesses have suffered similarly—and how many does it take to fix this problem? The fax company was willing to make it good but only on their terms and conditions. A small business like mine cannot function without computers and fax machines. We do not have the luxury of waiting for days or weeks. What this company really lost was the opportunity to ever do business with me and my circle of friends and acquaintances ever again. I call this the cost of “lost opportunity.” They had a chance to become a hero in my next book or speech. Instead, they will be the butt of my jokes because they did a very lousy job of doing a very right thing. I don’t like having these disappointing stories to tell; I would much rather find heroes and sheroes that I can brag about in my books and from the platform—people who will go beyond the call of duty to make a bad thing good. There are indeed some of those out there—and you have the power to become one. Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Fix the problem; don’t lay the blame. 2. Good service will pay you huge dividends. Lousy service will cost you dearly. 3. Do the right thing, but do it right. Don’t make the customer’s life any more difficult.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 4 Always Give Them a Baker’s Dozen Great customer service is about great listening skills. GEO Prism’s Mayday Back in the mid-eighties, I had the pleasure of doing a series of speeches for a company called New United Motors (NUMMI), a cross between Toyota and Chevrolet. The two companies came together to produce an automobile they called the Geo Prism . The most pioneering aspect of this partnership is that Geo was built under a Japanese (Toyota) management system with an American (Chevrolet) workforce. Though this looked on the surface like a potentially ill-fated combination, it actually became the key to their success. NUMMI did a very novel thing: They gathered salespeople from all over the world into their plant in Freemont, California, and showed them how they were going to build this new automobile. In fact, there were so many salespeople that they could not get them all into the building where I was speaking at one time. I had to give the same speech four different times that day to accommodate the sales force. Throughout the course of the day, I kept hearing some Japanese music ringing out arbitrarily from what sounded like different sections in the plant. At the end of the day, I asked the plant manager what the music represented. “That was our ‘mayday’ you heard,” he explained. “The music identifies exactly where in the plant we were experiencing a problem. Everyone in that area drops what they are doing and they go and solve the problem.” That is pretty ingenious thinking, I thought to myself, but I had to ask the next question. “What does the union think about that?” “They thought that was amazing,” he exclaimed with pride. “They had never heard of that before!” New United Motors was another champion that thought differently. Why? Because they were not afraid to throw out the traditional thinking and try something new. The answer is right there in their name: “new” and “united.” Baker’s Dozen These stories are so remarkable because they feature huge global corporations. While some might attest that they’re able to think differently because of huge size, that isn’t necessarily the case. They just spread the good word faster because they are big. The customer’s opinion is what drives this good news—and that’s a triumph that a company of any size can achieve. Creative Thinking One of the most creative thinkers I ever met was my own grandfather, Elias S. Mack, Sr., a Lebanese immigrant who came to this country with a third grade education. Like so many uneducated refugees, he became an entrepreneur by necessity, principally because no one would hire him. When he arrived on the shores of Ellis Island in New York, he was told he needed to change his birth name, Elias Skaff. “Look, Mack, you need to consider changing your name,” said the immigration officer. So, like many other immigrants, he took a new name: Mack. My grandfather ran a corner grocery store called Mack’s Cash and Carry Grocery. Like all small merchants, he built his business on being creative with his customers. “When they come in and buy a dozen apples, you always give them an extra one, because one might not be up to standard. Always give them a ‘baker’s dozen.’ That way, you will never disappoint.” My grandfather was a resourceful man in so many ways. When I was 11 years old, he gave me a book that he claimed would be very valuable to me one day. I opened the book and saw that contained nothing but blank pages. “The book has nothing in it,” I observed. “It has no value.” His response was simple: “What you put in it will make it valuable.” That book was the first of over 300 journals I now have. At the age of 11, an uneducated immigrant started the process of making me think in a different way. He would say to me, “If you want to be great, you must walk hand-in-hand and side-by-side and in the shadows of people who are great—and greatness will come unto you.” He was telling me that in America, you have choices. “You can be an eagle or a buzzard,” he would often say. “The difference is that one bird kills his own lunch and the other picks at the remains. You choose which you want to be.” A Journal for the Journey My grandfather told me that I needed a journal for the journey. What journey, I wanted to know? The journey called life. He told me that I would want to recall certain moments later in life and that a journal would be the best way to do it. My first task was to put something in the journal. At only 11 years old, I really did not know a lot about life. “What do you want to be when you grow up?” he asked rhetorically one afternoon when I was visiting him at his home. I had not given it a lot of thought. All I had ever done in my life was go to school, work in my grandfather’s grocery store as a bag boy, play sports like football and baseball, and join the Boy Scouts. My view of life was fairly narrow, to say the least. However, since I had absolutely no idea, the sky was the limit for me. To be a champion, you have to look beyond the customary boundaries. In fact, you have to remove all borders. That is exactly what my grandfather did with me. He asked me questions like, “What do you think about?” Well, I hadn’t given much thought to anything. But he pushed on. “Where do you get your inspiration?” he asked. “From Sunday Mass,” I responded. “Msgr. Joseph Bernadin is a great speaker at Mass.” This was the young priest at St. Peter’s Catholic Church in Columbia, South Carolina, who gave me my first Holy Communion and ultimately rose in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic faith to become a Cardinal. “He is a great speaker,” I told my grandfather. “I like the way he tells stories.” “Then perhaps you wish to become a priest when you grow up,” observed my grandfather. And I actually gave some thought to that process for a number of years until I learned about celibacy. (There went that goal.) However, I think the driving force to ultimately become a professional speaker got its roots from that priest at St. Peter’s Catholic Church, who himself was a powerful and yet humble speaker. My grandfather instructed me to take my journal to church on Sunday and record the things that Father Bernadin said. He taught me to keep a daily account of the events that took place in my life. My grandfather became deathly ill shortly after he introduced me to my first journal. I recall the summer of 1960 as if it were yesterday. I was only 11 years old, but I helped take care of my dying grandfather. I would fetch him figs off his favorite tree in the backyard or a drink from the kitchen. I would sit with him as we would watch television together. He hated commercials and insisted that I turn the television off during the commercial break. We would time it and turn it back on two minutes later. Those old television sets took 45 seconds to warm up, so I finally convinced him just to turn down the sound and leave the picture on. During those television commercials, we would talk about my journal. One of my grandfather’s first challenges was for me to make a list of 500 things I wanted to do in my life. I could barely think of 100 things at the age of 11—much less 500. So we would sit with the now-defunct Columbia Record —our afternoon daily newspaper—or The State newspaper, the morning daily, and the Lexington Dispatch-News . We would page through those papers and find articles about different things that we would discuss. Since I was interested in sports, I naturally put sports-related activities on my list of life goals. Not only did I want to play high school football, I wanted to play college ball and be in the National Football League. Unsurprisingly, I never made it to the NFL, but I probably would not have excelled at high school sports had I not put the pros on the list. When I wrote down that I wanted to be a priest on my list, it was not the priesthood to which I aspired; it was the thrill of motivating an audience like Msgr. Joseph Bernadin had done so well. His speaking acumen is why I ultimately joined Toastmasters in 1976 and eventually went on to compete in the World Championship of Public Speaking in 1978. Great Customer Service Starts with Even Greater Communication Skills I am one of the few Toastmaster World Champions who made more than one trip to the finals of the competition. I made it all the way to the International Speech Contest in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1977, only to be disqualified for going eight seconds over my allotted time limit. Frustrated at beating myself for going overtime, I went back through the arduous process in 1978 and again made it to the International Speech Contest finals, which were held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, that year. That year, I won the title. I am fond of telling my audiences today that you have to go through Toronto to get to Vancouver; in other words, you must experience defeat to truly appreciate victory. Champions must think that way. It was not about winning or losing for me; it was about the process of not beating myself. In fact, I rarely speak about the victory in Vancouver these days. I prefer to discuss how I overcame the defeat I suffered in Toronto. The roots of this entire story were established in the embryo of a journal I had started 17 years earlier in the small town of Lexington, South Carolina, at the encouragement of a Lebanese immigrant who thought it important enough to encourage his grandson to write things down. How blessed was I to have such a mentor in my life! YOU NEED A MENTOR A mentor will tell you two things: 1. What you are doing right, and 2. What you are doing wrong. My mentor was my grandfather; he taught me how to set goals in life. For that, I will be forever in his debt. I recently had the opportunity to review that first journal I wrote, and chuckled at the way my 11-year-old self looked at life. Though I’m amused at the way I tried to spell difficult words, the goals were crystal clear to me. Of the original 500 goals that I wrote down, I have accomplished (or scratched off as “not accomplishable”) some 487 of them. No, I’m not going to be a priest, but I would not be a professional speaker today had I not originally written priest on the list. No, I’m not going to be governor of South Carolina, but I would not have run for the House of Representatives in 1980 if I had not written governor on the original list. I learned that defeat is the process by which we succeed. God knows I have experienced enough defeat in my life, including that race in 1980. I have since found it is cheaper to buy a politician than it is to be one (just kidding). The goals you establish drive you; they have no borders, no ceilings, and no limits. Today, my list of goals has grown to several thousand, most of which I have accomplished. Though it’s been a challenge, it’s also been well worth it. This is not to say that there aren’t some obstacles along the way; in fact, there are a few major things that make reaching goals especially difficult. Four Reasons We Don’t Achieve Our Goals 1. We have been told about setting goals, but not sold on it. The Bible has an interesting line: “If the eye be single, the whole body is full of light. If the eye be evil, the whole body is full of darkness.” That means to me that if you are focused on accomplishing a goal, your process is immediately improved. You are halfway there. Goals must be challenging, yet accomplishable. They must have deadlines, and you must be accountable to them. 2. We have not been shown how to set a goal. If you will simply answer the questions “who, what, when, where, why, and how,” you will know how to set a goal for yourself. Answering those questions clarifies the process. It is your road map to success. 3. We are afraid we are going to fail. No one likes to fail. It is the single biggest obstacle to setting a goal in life. There’s no danger of failing, of course, if we don’t even try in the first place. 4. We are afraid we might succeed . Though it sounds strange, social scientists claim that the greatest reason we do not set goals is because we feel that we don’t deserve the success that comes with accomplishing them. In fact, this reason outweighs the rest combined. We truly fear success! When John F. Kennedy was running for the presidency in 1959, a reporter posed a rather challenging question to him. “Senator Kennedy, if you could be guaranteed to be the next vice president of the United States, would you accept that guarantee as opposed to running for president and possibly losing?” I never will forget Kennedy’s response: “Why should I accept number two when number one is available?” Though Kennedy clearly did not fear success, most other people do. We tend to think we do not deserve it, and accept second best simply because it is available. What if Kennedy had listened to his peers and taken the vice presidency? He might never have been elected to the top office in the land. How many times have you listened to others’ criticism and negative words? My grandfather gave me a wonderful piece of advice prior to his death: “Listen to the criticism of others, but do not support them. There is no such thing as constructive criticism,” he explained. “Most criticism is destructive, because more often than not, the person doing the criticizing is criticizing the performer and not the performance . You have to separate the two.” I was standing in line at my local bank one day behind a young woman who had her little son Henry with her. How did I know his name was Henry? She called him down 15 times while we waited for her to reach the teller cage. “Henry, stay in line.” “Henry, get back over here, boy, or I’m going to pop you one.” “Henry, you better get right and I mean right now.” She half turned to me and said, “Henry, if you don’t straighten up, I’m going to give you to that man!” I did not want him, but I would have taken him after what she said next. “Henry, if you don’t straighten up, you’re going to end up in jail one day.” Would you be surprised to read about little Henry going to jail in 15 years? GIGO: Garbage in and you get garbage out. Our Training Dictates Our Values and Behavior I recall when our twin sons Cory and Jason were in the first grade, the teachers decided to separate them, putting them in different classes. I am convinced they did this because they just did not want to be bothered at figuring out who was who, but we went along with the experiment, which interestingly gave us an opportunity to compare teachers. Mind you, all teachers have their own style. I won’t say one was negative, but she had been weaned on a pickle. The negative teacher would send home the child’s assignments: “Dear parent, see that your child does this and this and this. Signed, the teacher.” The positive teacher would write, “Dear pumpkins, this week we’re going to work on this task, this task, and this task. It’s tough, but you’re smart. I’ve seen your work and I know that you can do this. Signed, With Love, Mrs. Casey.” Which teacher would you rather have? Mrs. Casey, of course! Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Always give them a baker’s dozen. Promise a lot; deliver more. 2. Great communication skills start with great listening skills. 3. Never fear failure; it is the process by which we succeed. 4. Work with mentors and become a mentor to others. It will make you a better person.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 5 Trust, Once Violated, Negates a Relationship If 20 clients are unhappy with your service, 19 won’t bother to tell you. Fourteen of the 20 will simply take their business elsewhere. The late great life insurance guru John Savage was a close friend of mine. His favorite expression was “Trust, once violated, negates a relationship.” Was he ever right! The violation of our client’s and customer’s trust is the number one thing that causes them to seek products or services elsewhere. Some 19 of 20 unhappy clients won’t even bother to tell you—and 14 simply end up doing business elsewhere, probably with your competition. Take care of your client or someone else will. It is as simple as that. Taxpayers Are Customers, Too My weekly column, “Behind the Mike,” appears in over 600 publications all over the world. One of our Ohio readers brought to our attention the fact that the local school board canceled high school football and all other extracurricular activities in Grove City, Ohio, just six miles southwest of the capital city of Columbus. Though I guess it’s merely a sign of the times, it begs the question: Why? Aren’t we taxpayers the clients and customers of government—be it local, state, or national? Why are we summarily dismissed without regard to our thoughts, feelings, or beliefs? Unfortunately, we have to wait until the next election to vote the bums out. They have lost our trust, which is the single most abiding thing they want from us besides our loyalty and our vote. Normally 11,000 screaming fans should have gathered at Grove City High for something that is a rite of passage for high school kids: a high school football game on a Friday night. It is not just football that was canceled, but a way of life for kids everywhere. Anyone who ever played under the Friday night lights knows that warm glow that comes over you when family, friends, and neighbors gather to cheer on the local kids, win or lose. Unfortunately, that tradition got the hatchet. Cheerleaders who lead the Friday afternoon pep rallies no longer have anything to cheer about. The marching Greyhound band that normally plays to a capacity house no longer entertains. Sadly, these same financial strains affect school boards in every city and every state. While no one wants to judge this particular issue, it does raise some interesting questions. It turns out the South-Western City School Board, which includes four high schools, took the unprecedented step of canceling all extracurricular activities after voters failed to pass an operating levy. Now four high schools in Ohio’s sixth-largest school district have no sports, no bands, no drama productions, and no student council. Was this a move to get even with the voters? Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven; Nobody Wants to Die! Neighbors have turned on one another in anger. I am reminded of the age-old saying: “Everybody wants to go to heaven; nobody wants to die.” Everybody wants paved roads and good schools; nobody wants to pay the taxes necessary to pave and build them. Everybody wants quality education for their kids and grandkids; nobody wants to foot the bill. There is another old saying: “We get the kind of government we deserve.” I personally reject that as not exactly being the “whole” truth. The situation in South-Western was extreme but not necessarily unusual. Across the nation, school districts are wrestling with a fundamental question. When money is tight, should taxpayers be funding high school sports? When you put 11,000 people in the stands, one would think that sport should be able to not only pay for itself but all the other sports combined. Unless they are giving away the seats, this should be a no-brainer. In Mount Vernon, New York, students, parents, coaches, teachers, and community leaders raised nearly $1 million to fund the school district’s sports program for the 2008–2009 school year after voters twice declined to pass the district budget and forced the district into austerity mode. The budget was passed—with funding for athletics—for the current school year. The net result of such extreme measures is that parents will move their kids to other districts that still play football. Let the mass exodus begin—not just of students, but also coaches and teachers. Talk about cutting your nose off to spite your face. Perhaps the more important question here is: How does one get elected to a school board that looks only to cut instead of looking for solutions? Is this a way of blackmailing a community into a tax increase? If you tried such drastic measures in most small towns, you would have a major rebellion on your hands. The community will begin to wilt and die when you take the blossom off the trees. Everybody wants to go to heaven; nobody wants to die. This scene could be coming to a community near you. We Need a Customer Rebellion Perhaps what is called for is something that the parents in Mount Vernon did to some degree: launch a customer rebellion. When governments do things in a way that angers the populace, they deserve the results of that anger. Unfortunately, you have to wait for the next election to settle the score. Clients and customers do not have to wait, however; they get to vote immediately. Make no mistake, the people in the affected communities feel just as violated as the client who buys a lemon from a disreputable car dealer. Making Life Difficult Seems to Be the Goal of Some I was speaking in Hartford, Connecticut, recently when I learned of the death of my uncle, former mayor of Lexington, South Carolina. Naturally, I wanted to get back as soon as possible so that I could make arrangements to attend his funeral in South Carolina and eulogize him. However, I learned that in order to change my midmorning flight to an earlier one, I would have to pay what amounted to double the cost of the original flight. Fair enough; I understand that airlines are hurting and that fees have to be charged. However, let’s examine the dynamics of this. First, there were empty seats on the earlier flight, which was departing at 6:00 am, while the more popular, later flight was much fuller. Simply putting me on the earlier flight would have gotten me home in time to attend the funeral without rushing— and freed up a seat on the more popular midmorning flight. I decided not to pay the double air fare—but not without questioning the situation’s logic. After all, one would think that the airlines would have been grateful for my gesture of making space available on a later flight by agreeing to get up at 3:00 am and to the airport by 5:00 am I asked the gate agent about making the change, but he was operating out of the Official Airline Customer Irritation Manual . The airline failed to empower the gate agent to make a heroic gesture that would make a deposit into the all-important “favor bank.” That’s right; they could have enjoyed positive dedication from a heretofore loyal passenger. They sadly have lost that forever. Mind you, this was not some $50 change fee but double the original airfare. I actually moved to Orlando, Florida, because I got tired of going there for speaking engagements. I used to fly a lot and have millions of miles with Delta, United, and others, but today, I actually drive to many of my speaking engagements because I live in St. Cloud, Florida. In the old glory days of Delta, I was awarded a Flying Colonel distinction. I had so many miles with them that any request of this nature was granted and never questioned. Those days are long gone, which is why I moved to Orlando. It is just not worth getting on an airplane anymore. But duty calls and I still have to fly from time to time. In my mind, I was actually trying to figure out why the fare had doubled. I was still getting the same bag of peanuts and still flying the same distance. What were their real costs of accommodating me in my time of grief? As best I could figure it, the worst that could happen is that I would free up a seat on the later flight that they could actually sell to another poor soul who had to be somewhere that day. Trust, Once Violated, Negates a Relationship The airline lost my faith and trust forever that day, all because of their greed. I am now one of the 20 unhappy clients, 19 of whom will simply take the business to their competitor in the future. They have lost my future business and are totally unaware as to why. They had a chance to gain a lifetime of trust and loyalty with one kind gesture—and instead they poisoned the pool forever. This same airline brags about its friendliness and the fact that you do not have to pay to check your bags with them. The fact is they do not want you checking your bags because it adversely affects their on-time departure. The fact is they have cut so many corners trying to be “on time” that they have made it to the FAA’s watch list for safety concerns. Why would they spend millions of dollars advertising their great business practices and then make a bonehead decision like this one? Profit versus Prophet This very same airline is the subject of many great atta-boy articles in many customer focus books. Some even call them a “prophet” for the airline industry—but as far as I’m concerned, they’re more interested in “profit” than in being a “prophet.” Granted, this is an isolated circumstance, but it does beg the question: What were they thinking? What would have been lost by this—several hundred dollars more “pure profit”? Are greed and profit that important? Wouldn’t the airline have a greater perceived value if they had given their gate agent the ability to collaborate with the client for a solution? Was their airfare based on an additional fee for value or just a way to make more money? Instead of addressing my situation, the airline missed a golden opportunity to address my needs, which were legitimate and timely, not situational or cumulatively punitive to the airline. They never bothered to engage me or diagnose my issues. They never attempted to make any exception to the Official Airline Customer Irritation Manual . They were concerned with one thing and one thing only—“profit.” They could have been a “prophet” but that opportunity is lost forever. Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Take care of your client or someone else will. It is just that simple. If 20 clients are unhappy, 19 won’t bother to tell you—and 14 will simply go elsewhere. 2. Build trust with your client, and you earn their undying loyalty and dedication—which is worth its weight in gold. 3. It takes a very forgiving client to come back for second helpings when trust is lost. Most times, they simply won’t do it.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 6 Somebody Has to Take Out the Trash! Up to 90 percent of unhappy clients will not buy from you again, and they won’t bother to tell you why. Client Retention Should Be the Model, Not the Exception Customer retention is not only a cost-effective and highly profitable strategy; in today’s very competitive climate, it is absolutely necessary if you are in business for the long haul. This is critical, given the fact that 80 percent of business comes from 20 percent of your client base. Still, most marketing and advertising campaigns are so highly focused on attracting new customers that they practically ignore the loyal clients who have been there for years. One of the best examples I can think of comes from the world of the highly competitive wireless telephone industry. Most companies here have the audacity to offer a huge rebate or free cellular phone to a new customer, while giving current clients the privilege of paying full price. All this does is force loyal clients go elsewhere, which is exactly the opposite of what it is trying to accomplish. Sadly, one of the most telling statistics of all in the client relations arena is this one: 90 percent of unhappy clients abandon you and they don’t even bother to tell you why. They simply fire you as their vendor or provider. Period. No questions asked. No apologies rendered. None expected. I would far rather have an angry client than one that has no agenda whatsoever. I would rather hear 10 objections to my proposal than one indifferent person who has no opinion. I would rather be slam-dunked by a furious customer than be politely dismissed by one who just doesn’t care. Perhaps indifference is the key word in this scenario. To begin with, it is a lot easier to have a discussion with a client than to do so with a prospect. A client has previously made a decision and had a reason to buy from you; a prospect has not. One of the most powerful aspects about the insurance company I represent, the Knights of Columbus, is the client loyalty that our members offer us. Many of them have as many as 30 or 40 contracts with the Knights, and you can summarize the reason in one word: loyalty. It clearly explains why they purchase so much and are so loyal to us. While I’d like to think that it has something to do with our agents doing a great job in the field, the fact is these people are dedicated to the quality of our products and fraternity. All I Want Out of Life Is an Unfair Advantage I have a basic philosophy in life: “All I want out of life is an unfair advantage.” The unfair advantage of the Knights of Columbus Insurance is the quality of its people and products. Only two companies in the world have our ratings, a fact that speaks volumes to the 1.8 million members worldwide about who we are and what we represent. A company earns this kind of dedication over more than a century of providing quality service; it doesn’t just “happen.” While the persistency in our agency is around 95 percent, it still means that 5 percent of the people changed their minds. By industry standards, 95 percent is excellent. By my standards, 5 percent got away from us—and I want to know why. Why Do Your Clients Fire You? Sometimes a client fires you because of domestic or financial reasons. Sometimes they find a better deal or a product you do not offer. You recognize it and live with what you cannot change. However, the things you influence in some way are the ones that should never go unattended. A client’s displeasure with your product or service is an invitation to address a problem. When one of our members calls in to cancel his certificate, my philosophy is simple: “A buying decision is going on, and I want to be a part of it.” I don’t care whether the commission trail has run out or not. I hate to lose business to another competitor. If a client gives us profound reasons for switching companies and I do not have a competitive product, I’ll be the first to advise him or her to make the move. But more often than not, your competition is preying on your client and simply trying to line their own pockets. We have a fiduciary responsibility to let the client know when they are making a mistake. Don’t let your competition set that table. They are not going to share all the facts. Defend your company’s practices, whether or not it’s commissionable to you as a salesperson. Doing this screams volumes to your client that their needs are paramount. Somebody Has to Take Out the Trash There are occasions when a previous sales representative may have misstated a product or service. In those cases, somebody has to step in and educate that client. Someone has to fix the problem and take out the trash. The greatest motivational principle in the world is the truth. It’s right there in the manufacturer’s handbook (the Bible): “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” The truth always works —and most of us are not smart enough to be good liars, anyway. Put Them All on Commission I have always believed in having people on commission, including secretaries and administrative people. My philosophy is simple: Rewarding good behavior begets good behavior. Case in point: While suffering through my four-mile workout on the treadmill at the local sweat factory recently, I was reading a USA Today article about the compensation of America’s top college football coaches. I have learned two things about compensation systems. 1. If you show me the reward system of any institution, I will show you where they place their values. 2. Second: If you pay peanuts, you generally get monkeys. What possesses the University of Florida, for example, to pony up $4 million to coach Urban Meyer? Answer: He generates many times that in revenues! The age-old argument from tenured professors about how much more valuable they are to the educational institution than coaches falls on deaf ears for the most part. The fact is that professors are tenured and coaches are not. You cannot fire a professor, no matter how sorry they are. At least the university can get rid of a coach who’s not getting the job done. Another issue is the range of compensation from one school to another. For instance, the 2009 base salary for Coach Dabo Swinney at Clemson was only $816,850. One could argue that the Tiger IPTAY Club, the fundraising arm of Clemson University, generates as much or more gifting income than the majority of universities and colleges that pay their coaches much higher salaries. Coach Swinney’s efforts on the gridiron directly impact the giving—so shouldn’t he be on commission? Instead, the compensation for a Clemson head coach was actually reduced by 32 percent when Swinney took over after the previous coach was fired for not winning enough football games. However, Swinney took less of a hit than Navy head coach Ken Numatalolo. Though his income was reduced 53 percent in 2009, his Midshipmen beat up on Notre Dame for the second year in a row. Numatalolo’s income was a fraction of Charlie Weis’s salary, a man whom Notre Dame fired in 2009. Perhaps they ought to put coaches on commission like salespeople. If you win and generate revenue, you get a piece of the pie. If you win and lose money, you get a smaller piece of the pie. If you lose, you get no pie. That is how it works in my world. I get paid when my feet hit the floor and only after I produce results. As a matter of fact, I believe you can put almost any job on commission. All you have to do is define what winning behavior looks like and place a value on it. Of course, there are arguments made to the contrary about rewarding people based on performance. What will the union think? What will the rank-and-file think? Will the employees embrace “performance-based” compensation? Will it result in long-range meaningful dollars or just a short-term flash-in-the-pan? And what about the proper mix of compensation elements? Can a balance be struck between short- and long-term incentives, and will it lead to achieving the overall goals of the organization? Blah, blah, blah. You keep score in athletics—so why not pay for performance? Then when someone cheats, lies, or steals, dock their pay or fire them. How hard is this? Don’t reward people who win “at any cost”; reward people who win fairly. Fix the Problem, Not the Blame My dear friend and co-author of another book, Jeff Slutsky, is a marketing guru who founded Streetfighter Marketing, an Ohio-based firm that specializes in unusual approaches to unusual problems. In our book, The Toastmasters International Guide to Successful Speaking (Dearborn Publishing, 1996), Jeff tells many terrific stories about how he made streetfighters out of his clients—one of which comes to mind. Jeff had a pizza vendor for a client who had to compete with pizza giant Domino’s. Domino’s vendors used a clever marketing approach that included buying the biggest Yellow Pages ad that was available to them through the local phone directory because their research suggested that clients simply called the first ad they could find. Someone who wanted home delivery pizza would grab the phone book and immediately be drawn to the full-page ad on the back cover. His client was a half a step away from calling it quits when he asked Jeff to solve the problem. Jeff asked his client some simple questions that boiled down to: What is ailing you, and how can I fix it? Answer: The competition is all but putting him out of business. The solution is more business. Jeff then asked the client how much money he had budgeted to address the problem. He took this figure and said, “Send me half for my retainer and take the other half down to the local radio station that has the biggest audience share in your immediate market area. Buy all the advertising sound bites that you can with that money and use this script: ‘Bring us the Domino’s Pizza ad from your local phone book and we’ll give you two pizzas for the price of one.’” Within days, the vendor had regained his lost market share and then some. Granted, this was back in the day when people used phone books and pay phones. However, the concept of bringing a competitor’s coupons to match or beat the price is a valuable one in most industries. Huge grocery chains are constantly advertising that they will honor or in some cases double the rebates offered by others. In this dog-eat-dog competitive world, you have to use the “unfair advantage.” Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Remember, it’s the client who fires you. Sadly, 90 percent of them won’t even bother to tell you why. 2. Somebody has to take out the trash. You can fire the person who caused the problem later. Just make the client whole again now! 3. Client retention is markedly cheaper than the cost of finding a new client. 4. All I—and most people—want out of life is an unfair advantage.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 7 You Are Not the Enemy but Part of the Solution Ninety-six percent of unhappy clients do not complain of poor service. Every bit of research on the issue suggests a number of alarming facts about the customers who don’t bother to complain about getting lousy service. Alarmingly, 96 percent of unhappy clients do not complain. A closer look at this fact suggests three understandable reasons: 1. It’s not worth their time. 2. You aren’t listening. 3. You won’t respond. If you gather around your brain-trusts and posed these comments to them, it would come back smelling like this: “You’ll do okay if you just handle the complaint.” As we are fond of saying in our insurance agency: “Somebody has to take out the trash.” If a customer goes to the trouble to complain but remains unhappy, they will be even less loyal than the one who doesn’t bother to complain in the first place. A big part of the problem is that most businesses have very lousy complaint processes. You have to jump through far too many hoops to get from point A to point B, and most customers decide that it’s simply not worth their time. This immediately discourages them from ever doing business with you again—even if you were to drastically cut prices. Customers rarely care about price; they always care about the level of service you render. In the end, the company’s response, or lack thereof, tends to be the real problem. Why is that? Mr./Ms. Client . . . You Are a Liar and a Thief! Many so-called customer service reps launch the complaint process with the belief that the customer has a hidden agenda; that is, they are simply looking for something for nothing. Why not go ahead and just flat-out call your client a liar and a thief? Moreover, these “fixers” rarely fix anything. In fact, they compound the problem by running the poor customer through the drill: “Did you follow the detailed instructions? This damage could not possibly have happened on our end; did you do something to cause it?” In the end, the poor customer throws their hands up in the air and walks away, never to do business with you again. Does that mean there aren’t people out there who are looking for a handout? Absolutely not. Scam artists, liars, and cheats exist. The key is to use your skills to find out what the real issues are. Learn the power of asking open-ended, rhetorical questions that begin with the words “who, what, when, where, why, or how.” These questions lead to open-ended responses. The Person Asking the Questions in the Interview Process Controls the Interview When an inbound call comes to your phone, don’t ask the client, “How can I be of help to you?” if you really don’t want to be of help. It insults their intelligence. They are already angry that the gadget or service they purchased does not work. Why compound the problem? Acknowledge it. There are four keys to dealing with the complaint: 1. Soften the complaint. 2. Isolate it; don’t ramble into other areas. Work on the problem at hand. 3. Rephrase it to the client so that both you and the client are clear on what the actual issue is. 4. Work together toward a solution. Let Them Know That You Are Not the Enemy Some time ago I was on a flight to Maui for a conference. I had to connect through O’Hare Airport—a zoo on a good day, but almost unbearable during the cold, harsh Chicago winters. On this particular day, it was snowing and sleeting harder by the minute. Flights were being delayed and canceled because of the weather. The gate agent was trying her best to get as many people transferred to a plane that had be de-iced and was about to depart for Hawaii. I’m in line behind a belligerent man who was using the “bigger hammer” approach to try to get his way. You know the type. “If I hit her with a bigger hammer I’ll get my way.” You could tell how perturbed the agent was. Finally, she quietly leaned across the counter and in a soft voice she said: “Sir, there are two people in the world who give a damn about your problem . . . and one of them is fast losing interest.” Finally, the confrontational passenger understood that the likelihood of him getting on that plane lay squarely in the attendant’s hands—and so he straightened up. Ultimately, she got him on board. She knew the important lesson that you sometimes have to give an aggressive client a “time-out” if they insist on being unreasonable. When a client complains, it is perfectly okay to let them know that you are not the enemy and that you are seriously interested in solving their problem. Making a Mountain Out of a Molehill Another common problem with complaining consumers is that they often want to magnify the problem beyond its true scope. We all have rules that we have to live by; they exist for everyone’s benefit. Keep the complaint within the rules. You can’t perform miracles and you can’t fulfill unreasonable expectations simply because a client has been harmed. You can’t give a client a $2,000 computer because his $100 fax machine failed. Make them whole—not “whole times 20.” It really requires getting the mountain down to the molehill. Isolate the problem, and then solve it aggressively. If the client’s interpretation of a solution is different than yours, either you are not being fair or they are being unreasonable. Some of the latest television ads have the cook stripping the deluxe hamburger of lettuce, tomato, and onion because the customer ordered a value meal. While the intent is to have some humor in their message, little things like charging for a refill of iced tea and running the tab up for a pickle make the entire experience just plain irritating. The solution is to clearly define the rules. The Irritation Factor Clearly, grumpy people don’t need to be heading up your client relations department. You have to have polite, courteous people handling this arena—because for most of these customers, you are already too late. For instance, client requests to surrender a policy with the Knights of Columbus typically travel by snail mail to our home office—which easily could take a week, based on where clients live. By the time it arrives and gets funneled down via e-mail, another day or two might be lost. Once received, we try to pass it along to the responsible agent that same day. However, the agent may chase the client by phone for several days before he can secure an appointment to help him with his request. In other words, by the time the agent gets in front of the member, a couple of weeks or more have passed—and the client is clearly irritated. He was thinking he’d have his check the next day, and is upset that the process took so long. The reason for the delay, unfortunately, was that the client went around the agent directly to the home office—a big “nuisance factor” for the customer. Fortunately, our agents are trained to handle these issues in a diplomatic fashion. Remember, it’s much more difficult to converse with a prospect who has fired you than it is with a client who has retained you. Minimizing Delays . . . Feel, Felt, Found The name of the game is to minimize delays . Get the word out quickly to the people responsible for the situation. In this digital age, that shouldn’t be too difficult a task. It is critical to maintain a sense of urgency when dealing with an unhappy client. A great opening statement follows the “feel-felt-found” formula: “Mr. Client, I think I know how you feel. I have felt that way also when trying to get a problem corrected. I’ve found that the best thing to do is to get down to the business of correcting it. Let’s get to the bottom of this. . . .” Now you are right in the middle of the problem-solving effort and clearly on the client’s side. Show a sense of urgency and respect; that’s usually what they want most. Train the Client on How to Be a Better Client One way to educate your clients on how to be better buyers of your products and services is to let them know the most effective way to address an issue at the time of the sale. Ask them to be specific and brief in the expression of their issues. Make 800 numbers and e-mail addresses available so that people have a quick way to express their annoyance with the situation. Inform them about your company’s processes, so that you can deliver the best possible results to them as quickly as possible. If a problem is ongoing, ask the client to retain letters, e-mails, and phone calls so that it is easier to reconstruct the history and thus work toward a suitable solution. Let’s face it, there are going to be problems. Customers today have been conditioned and understand that things occasionally go wrong. They simply want viable solutions. Here are 10 tips to establishing an effective education process: 1. Provide all contact numbers, e-mail addresses, and other communication vehicles at the point of sale so that the client is aware of how to get issues resolved. 2. Stress the importance of names, addresses, and contact information so that the proper people can reach them to resolve their issues. 3. Let clients know how you can best serve their needs when an issue arises. 4. Explain the process thoroughly; if possible, provide them with sample letters of common problems that surface. 5. Emphasize how critical it is to provide specific dates, places, amounts, and other details when communicating their message to you. 6. Let the client know that irrelevant details will only slow their request, and that they should focus on what needs to be fixed. 7. Find out what their favorite communication method is, and use that to get in touch with them. Many people want to call an 800 number, and others only want to do business digitally. Give them all the available options, and let them decide. 8. Create an easy follow-up process to make sure the issues were resolved. 9. Avoid being wishy-washy with them. Get to the point of how the issue can and will be resolved. 10. Be firm on agreed deadlines and deliver what you promise based on facts, not emotions. Takeaway Servicing and Selling Tactics 1. Ninety-six percent of unhappy customers will not bother to complain. They will simply take their business elsewhere. 2. Not everyone is out to get “something for nothing.” 3. Make mountains into molehills by isolating and defining the problem. 4. You are not the enemy. You are part of the solution. 5. Ask good open-ended questions to get to the root of the problem. 6. Educate the client on what good customer behavior looks like. 7. Become clients’ ally and proponent. 8. Act quickly on all issues. Follow up to make sure things were handled correctly. 9. Be thankful for those who do complain. It means that you have a client you can retain.",

        "text": "Drive INTRODUCTION I n the middle of the last century, two young scientists conducted experiments that should have changed the world but did not. Harry F. Harlow was a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin who, in the 1940s, established one of the world's first laboratories for studying primate behavior. One day in 1949, Harlow and two colleagues gathered eight rhesus monkeys for a two-week experiment on learning. The researchers devised a simple mechanical puzzle like the one pictured on the next page. Solving it required three steps: pull out the vertical pin, undo the hook, and lift the hinged cover. Pretty easy for you and me, far more challenging for a thirteen-pound lab monkey. Harlow's puzzle in the starting (left) and solved (right) positions. The experimenters placed the puzzles in the monkeys' cages to observe how they reacted and to prepare them for tests of their problem-solving prowess at the end of the two weeks. But almost immediately, something strange happened. Unbidden by any outside urging and unprompted by the experimenters, the monkeys began playing with the puzzles with focus, determination, and what looked like enjoyment. And in short order, they began figuring out how the contraptions worked. By the time Harlow tested the monkeys on days 13 and 14 of the experiment, the primates had become quite adept. They solved the puzzles frequently and quickly; two-thirds of the time they cracked the code in less than sixty seconds. Now, this was a bit odd. Nobody had taught the monkeys how to remove the pin, slide the hook, and open the cover. Nobody had rewarded them with food, affection, or even quiet applause when they succeeded. And that ran counter to the accepted notions of how primates including the bigger-brained, less hairy primates known as human beings behaved. Scientists then knew that two main drives powered behavior. The first was the biological drive. Humans and other animals ate to sate their hunger, drank to quench their thirst, and copulated to satisfy their carnal urges. But that wasn't happening here. Solution did not lead to food, water, or sex gratification, Harlow reported. But the only other known drive also failed to explain the monkeys' peculiar behavior. If biological motivations came from within, this second drive came from without the rewards and punishments the environment delivered for behaving in certain ways. This was certainly true for humans, who responded exquisitely to such external forces. If you promised to raise our pay, we'd work harder. If you held out the prospect of getting an A on the test, we'd study longer. If you threatened to dock us for showing up late or for incorrectly completing a form, we'd arrive on time and tick every box. But that didn't account for the monkeys' actions either. As Harlow wrote, and you can almost hear him scratching his head, The behavior obtained in this investigation poses some interesting questions for motivation theory, since significant learning was attained and efficient performance maintained without resort to special or extrinsic incentives. What else could it be? To answer the question, Harlow offered a novel theory what amounted to a third drive: The performance of the task, he said, provided intrinsic reward. The monkeys solved the puzzles simply because they found it gratifying to solve puzzles. They enjoyed it. The joy of the task was its own reward. If this notion was radical, what happened next only deepened the confusion and controversy. Perhaps this newly discovered drive Harlow eventually called it intrinsic motivation was real. But surely it was subordinate to the other two drives. If the monkeys were rewarded with raisins! for solving the puzzles, they'd no doubt perform even better. Yet when Harlow tested that approach, the monkeys actually made more errors and solved the puzzles less frequently. Introduction of food in the present experiment, Harlow wrote, served to disrupt performance, a phenomenon not reported in the literature. Now, this was really odd. In scientific terms, it was akin to rolling a steel ball down an inclined plane to measure its velocity only to watch the ball float into the air instead. It suggested that our understanding of the gravitational pulls on our behavior was inadequate that what we thought were fixed laws had plenty of loopholes. Harlow emphasized the strength and persistence of the monkeys' drive to complete the puzzles. Then he noted: It would appear that this drive . . . may be as basic and strong as the [other] drives. Furthermore, there is some reason to believe that [it] can be as efficient in facilitating learning. At the time, however, the prevailing two drives held a tight grip on scientific thinking. So Harlow sounded the alarm. He urged scientists to close down large sections of our theoretical junkyard and offer fresher, more accurate accounts of human behavior. He warned that our explanation of why we did what we did was incomplete. He said that to truly understand the human condition, we had to take account of this third drive. Then he pretty much dropped the whole idea. Rather than battle the establishment and begin offering a more complete view of motivation, Harlow abandoned this contentious line of research and later became famous for studies on the science of affection. His notion of this third drive bounced around the psychological literature, but it remained on the periphery of behavioral science and of our understanding of ourselves. It would be two decades before another scientist picked up the thread that Harlow had so provocatively left on that Wisconsin laboratory table. In the summer of 1969, Edward Deci was a Carnegie Mellon University psychology graduate student in search of a dissertation topic. Deci, who had already earned an MBA from Wharton, was intrigued by motivation but suspected that scholars and businesspeople had misunderstood it. So, tearing a page from the Harlow playbook, he set out to study the topic with the help of a puzzle. Deci chose the Soma puzzle cube, a then popular Parker Brothers offering that, thanks to YouTube, retains something of a cult following today. The puzzle, shown below, consists of seven plastic pieces six comprising four one-inch cubes, one comprising three one-inch cubes. Players can assemble the seven pieces into a few million possible combinations from abstract shapes to recognizable objects. The seven pieces of the Soma puzzle unassembled (left) and then fashioned into one of several million possible configurations. For the study, Deci divided participants, male and female university students, into an experimental group (what I'll call Group A) and a control group (what I'll call Group B). Each participated in three one-hour sessions held on consecutive days. Here's how the sessions worked: Each participant entered a room and sat at a table on top of which were the seven Soma puzzle pieces, drawings of three puzzle configurations, and copies of Time , The New Yorker , and Playboy . (Hey, it was 1969.) Deci sat on the opposite end of the table to explain the instructions and to time performance with a stopwatch. In the first session, members of both groups had to assemble the Soma pieces to replicate the configurations before them. In the second session, they did the same thing with different drawings only this time Deci told Group A that they'd be paid $1 (the equivalent of nearly $6 today) for every configuration they successfully reproduced. Group B, meanwhile, got new drawings but no pay. Finally, in the third session, both groups received new drawings and had to reproduce them for no compensation, just as in session one. (See the table below.) HOW THE TWO GROUPS WERE TREATED The twist came midway through each session. After a participant had assembled the Soma puzzle pieces to match two of the three drawings, Deci halted the proceedings. He said that he was going to give them a fourth drawing but to choose the right one, he needed to feed their completion times into a computer. And this being the late 1960s, when room-straddling mainframes were the norm and desktop PCs were still a decade away that meant he had to leave for a little while. On the way out, he said, I shall be gone only a few minutes, you may do whatever you like while I'm gone. But Deci wasn't really plugging numbers into an ancient teletype. Instead, he walked to an adjoining room connected to the experiment room by a one-way window. Then, for exactly eight minutes, he watched what people did when left alone. Did they continue fiddling with the puzzle, perhaps attempting to reproduce the third drawing? Or did they do something else page through the magazines, check out the centerfold, stare into space, catch a quick nap? In the first session, not surprisingly, there wasn't much difference between what the Group A and Group B participants did during that secretly watched eight-minute free-choice period. Both continued playing with the puzzle, on average, for between three and a half and four minutes, suggesting they found it at least somewhat interesting. On the second day, during which Group A participants were paid for each successful configuration and Group B participants were not, the unpaid group behaved mostly as they had during the first free-choice period. But the paid group suddenly got really interested in Soma puzzles. On average, the people in Group A spent more than five minutes messing with the puzzle, perhaps getting a head start on that third challenge or gearing up for the chance to earn some beer money when Deci returned. This makes intuitive sense, right? It's consistent with what we believe about motivation: Reward me and I'll work harder. Yet what happened on the third day confirmed Deci's own suspicions about the peculiar workings of motivation and gently called into question a guiding premise of modern life. This time, Deci told the participants in Group A that there was only enough money to pay them for one day and that this third session would therefore be unpaid. Then things unfolded just as before two puzzles, followed by Deci's interruption. During the ensuing eight-minute free-choice period, the subjects in the never-been-paid Group B actually played with the puzzle for a little longer than they had in previous sessions. Maybe they were becoming ever more engaged; maybe it was just a statistical quirk. But the subjects in Group A, who previously had been paid, responded differently. They now spent significantly less time playing with the puzzle not only about two minutes less than during their paid session, but about a full minute less than in the first session when they initially encountered, and obviously enjoyed, the puzzles. In an echo of what Harlow discovered two decades earlier, Deci revealed that human motivation seemed to operate by laws that ran counter to what most scientists and citizens believed. From the office to the playing field, we knew what got people going. Rewards especially cold, hard cash intensified interest and enhanced performance. What Deci found, and then confirmed in two additional studies he conducted shortly thereafter, was almost the opposite. When money is used as an external reward for some activity, the subjects lose intrinsic interest for the activity, he wrote. Rewards can deliver a short-term boost just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off and, worse, can reduce a person's longer-term motivation to continue the project. Human beings, Deci said, have an inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and exercise their capacities, to explore, and to learn. But this third drive was more fragile than the other two; it needed the right environment to survive. One who is interested in developing and enhancing intrinsic motivation in children, employees, students, etc., should not concentrate on external-control systems such as monetary rewards, he wrote in a f ollow-up paper. Thus began what for Deci became a lifelong quest to rethink why we do what we do a pursuit that sometimes put him at odds with fellow psychologists, got him fired from a business school, and challenged the operating assumptions of organizations everywhere. It was controversial, Deci told me one spring morning forty years after the Soma experiments. Nobody was expecting rewards would have a negative effect. THIS IS A BOOK about motivation. I will show that much of what we believe about the subject just isn't so and that the insights that Harlow and Deci began uncovering a few decades ago come much closer to the truth. The problem is that most businesses haven't caught up to this new understanding of what motivates us. Too many organizations not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science. They continue to pursue practices such as short-term incentive plans and pay-for-performance schemes in the face of mounting evidence that such measures usually don't work and often do harm. Worse, these practices have infiltrated our schools, where we ply our future workforce with iPods, cash, and pizza coupons to incentivize them to learn. Something has gone wrong. The good news is that the solution stands before us in the work of a band of behavioral scientists who have carried on the pioneering efforts of Harlow and Deci and whose quiet work over the last half-century offers us a more dynamic view of human motivation. For too long, there's been a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. The goal of this book is to repair that breach. Drive has three parts. Part One will look at the flaws in our reward-and-punishment system and propose a new way to think about motivation. Chapter 1 will examine how the prevailing view of motivation is becoming incompatible with many aspects of contemporary business and life. Chapter 2 will reveal the seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. (Following that is a short addendum, Chapter 2a, that shows the special circumstances when carrots and sticks actually can be effective.) Chapter 3 will introduce what I call Type I behavior, a way of thinking and an approach to business grounded in the real science of human motivation and powered by our third drive our innate need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Part Two will examine the three elements of Type I behavior and show how individuals and organizations are using them to improve performance and deepen satisfaction. Chapter 4 will explore autonomy, our desire to be self-directed. Chapter 5 will look at mastery, our urge to get better and better at what we do. Chapter 6 will explore purpose, our yearning to be part of something larger than ourselves. Part Three, the Type I Toolkit, is a comprehensive set of resources to help you create settings in which Type I behavior can flourish. Here you'll find everything from dozens of exercises to awaken motivation in yourself and others, to discussion questions for your book club, to a supershort summary of Drive that will help you fake your way through a cocktail party. And while this book is mostly about business, in this section I'll offer some thoughts about how to apply these concepts to education and to our lives outside of work. But before we get down to all that, let's begin with a thought experiment, one that requires going back in time to the days when John Major was Britain's prime minister, Barack Obama was a skinny young law professor, Internet connections were dial-up, and a blackberry was still just a fruit.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 1 The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0 I magine it's 1995. You sit down with an economist an accomplished business school professor with a Ph.D. in economics. You say to her: I've got a crystal ball here that can peer fifteen years into the future. I'd like to test your forecasting powers. She's skeptical, but she decides to humor you. I'm going to describe two new encyclopedias one just out, the other to be launched in a few years. You have to predict which will be more successful in 2010. Bring it, she says. The first encyclopedia comes from Microsoft. As you know, Microsoft is already a large and profitable company. And with this year's introduction of Windows 95, it's about to become an era-defining colossus. Microsoft will fund this encyclopedia. It will pay professional writers and editors to craft articles on thousands of topics. Well-compensated managers will oversee the project to ensure it's completed on budget and on time. Then Microsoft will sell the encyclopedia on CD-ROMs and later online. The second encyclopedia won't come from a company. It will be created by tens of thousands of people who write and edit articles for fun. These hobbyists won't need any special qualifications to participate. And nobody will be paid a dollar or a euro or a yen to write or edit articles. Participants will have to contribute their labor sometimes twenty and thirty hours per week for free. The encyclopedia itself, which will exist online, will also be free no charge for anyone who wants to use it. Now, you say to the economist, think forward fifteen years. According to my crystal ball, in 2010, one of these encyclopedias will be the largest and most popular in the world and the other will be defunct. Which is which? In 1995, I doubt you could have a found a single sober economist anywhere on planet Earth who would not have picked that first model as the success. Any other conclusion would have been laughable contrary to nearly every business principle she taught her students. It would have been like asking a zoologist who would win a 200-meter footrace between a cheetah and your brother-in-law. Not even close. Sure, that ragtag band of volunteers might produce something. But there was no way its product could compete with an offering from a powerful profit-driven company. The incentives were all wrong. Microsoft stood to gain from the success of its product; everyone involved in the other project knew from the outset that success would earn them nothing. Most important, Microsoft's writers, editors, and managers were paid. The other project's contributors were not. In fact, it probably cost them money each time they performed free work instead of remunerative labor. The question was such a no-brainer that our economist wouldn't even have considered putting it on an exam for her MBA class. It was too easy. But you know how things turned out. On October 31, 2009, Microsoft pulled the plug on MSN Encarta , its disc and online encyclopedia, which had been on the market for sixteen years. Meanwhile, Wikipedia that second model ended up becoming the largest and most popular encyclopedia in the world. Just eight years after its inception, Wikipedia had more than 13 million articles in some 260 languages, including 3 million in English alone. What happened? The conventional view of human motivation has a very hard time explaining this result. THE TRIUMPH OF CARROTS AND STICKS C omputers whether the giant mainframes in Deci's experiments, the iMac on which I'm writing this sentence, or the mobile phone chirping in your pocket all have operating systems. Beneath the surface of the hardware you touch and the programs you manipulate is a complex layer of software that contains the instructions, protocols, and suppositions that enable everything to function smoothly. Most of us don't think much about operating systems. We notice them only when they start failing when the hardware and software they're supposed to manage grow too large and complicated for the current operating system to handle. Then our computer starts crashing. We complain. And smart software developers, who've always been tinkering with pieces of the program, sit down to write a fundamentally better one an upgrade. Societies also have operating systems. The laws, social customs, and economic arrangements that we encounter each day sit atop a layer of instructions, protocols, and suppositions about how the world works. And much of our societal operating system consists of a set of assumptions about human behavior. In our very early days I mean very early days, say, fifty thousand years ago the underlying assumption about human behavior was simple and true. We were trying to survive. From roaming the savannah to gather food to scrambling for the bushes when a saber-toothed tiger approached, that drive guided most of our behavior. Call this early operating system Motivation 1.0. It wasn't especially elegant, nor was it much different from those of rhesus monkeys, giant apes, or many other animals. But it served us nicely. It worked well. Until it didn't. As humans formed more complex societies, bumping up against strangers and needing to cooperate in order to get things done, an operating system based purely on the biological drive was inadequate. In fact, sometimes we needed ways to restrain this drive to prevent me from swiping your dinner and you from stealing my spouse. And so in a feat of remarkable cultural engineering, we slowly replaced what we had with a version more compatible with how we'd begun working and living. At the core of this new and improved operating system was a revised and more accurate assumption: Humans are more than the sum of our biological urges. That first drive still mattered no doubt about that but it didn't fully account for who we are. We also had a second drive to seek reward and avoid punishment more broadly. And it was from this insight that a new operating system call it Motivation 2.0 arose. (Of course, other animals also respond to rewards and punishments, but only humans have proved able to channel this drive to develop everything from contract law to convenience stores.) Harnessing this second drive has been essential to economic progress around the world, especially during the last two centuries. Consider the Industrial Revolution. Technological developments steam engines, railroads, widespread electricity played a crucial role in fostering the growth of industry. But so did less tangible innovations in particular, the work of an American engineer named Frederick Winslow Taylor. In the early 1900s, Taylor, who believed businesses were being run in an inefficient, haphazard way, invented what he called scientific management. His invention was a form of software expertly crafted to run atop the Motivation 2.0 platform. And it was widely and quickly adopted. Workers, this approach held, were like parts in a complicated machine. If they did the right work in the right way at the right time, the machine would function smoothly. And to ensure that happened, you simply rewarded the behavior you sought and punished the behavior you discouraged. People would respond rationally to these external forces these extrinsic motivators and both they and the system itself would flourish. We tend to think that coal and oil have powered economic development. But in some sense, the engine of commerce has been fueled equally by carrots and sticks. The Motivation 2.0 operating system has endured for a very long time. Indeed, it is so deeply embedded in our lives that most of us scarcely recognize that it exists. For as long as any of us can remember, we've configured our organizations and constructed our lives around its bedrock assumption: The way to improve performance, increase productivity, and encourage excellence is to reward the good and punish the bad. Despite its greater sophistication and higher aspirations, Motivation 2.0 still wasn't exactly ennobling. It suggested that, in the end, human beings aren't much different from horses that the way to get us moving in the right direction is by dangling a crunchier carrot or wielding a sharper stick. But what this operating system lacked in enlightenment, it made up for in effectiveness. It worked well extremely well. Until it didn't. As the twentieth century progressed, as economies grew still more complex, and as the people in them had to deploy new, more sophisticated skills, the Motivation 2.0 approach encountered some resistance. In the 1950s, Abraham Maslow, a former student of Harry Harlow's at the University of Wisconsin, developed the field of humanistic psychology, which questioned the idea that human behavior was purely the ratlike seeking of positive stimuli and avoidance of negative stimuli. In 1960, MIT management professor Douglas McGregor imported some of Maslow's ideas to the business world. McGregor challenged the presumption that humans are fundamentally inert that absent external rewards and punishments, we wouldn't do much. People have other, higher drives, he said. And these drives could benefit businesses if managers and business leaders respected them. Thanks in part to McGregor's writing, companies evolved a bit. Dress codes relaxed, schedules became more flexible. Many organizations looked for ways to grant employees greater autonomy and to help them grow. These refinements repaired some weaknesses, but they amounted to a modest improvement rather than a thorough upgrade Motivation 2.1. And so this general approach remained intact because it was, after all, easy to understand, simple to monitor, and straightforward to enforce. But in the first ten years of this century a period of truly staggering underachievement in business, technology, and social progress we've discovered that this sturdy, old operating system doesn't work nearly as well. It crashes often and unpredictably. It forces people to devise workarounds to bypass its flaws. Most of all, it is proving incompatible with many aspects of contemporary business. And if we examine those incompatibility problems closely, we'll realize that modest updates a patch here or there will not solve the problem. What we need is a full-scale upgrade. THREE INCOMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS M otivation 2.0 still serves some purposes well. It's just deeply unreliable. Sometimes it works; many times it doesn't. And understanding its defects will help determine which parts to keep and which to discard as we fashion an upgrade. The glitches fall into three broad categories. Our current operating system has become far less compatible with, and at times downright antagonistic to: how we organize what we do; how we think about what we do; and how we do what we do. How We Organize What We Do Go back to that encyclopedic showdown between Microsoft and Wikipedia. The assumptions at the heart of Motivation 2.0 suggest that such a result shouldn't even be possible. Wikipedia's triumph seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics. Now, if this all-volunteer, all-amateur encyclopedia were the only instance of its kind, we might dismiss it as an aberration, an exception that proves the rule. But it's not. Instead, Wikipedia represents the most powerful new business model of the twenty-first century: open source. Fire up your home computer, for example. When you visit the Web to check the weather forecast or order some sneakers, you might be using Firefox, a free open-source Web browser created almost exclusively by volunteers around the world. Unpaid laborers who give away their product? That couldn't be sustainable. The incentives are all wrong. Yet Firefox now has more than 150 million users. Or walk into the IT department of a large company anywhere in the world and ask for a tour. That company's corporate computer servers could well run on Linux, software devised by an army of unpaid programmers and available for free. Linux now powers one in four corporate servers. Then ask an employee to explain how the company's website works. Humming beneath the site is probably Apache, free open-source Web server software created and maintained by a far-flung global group of volunteers. Apache's share of the corporate Web server market: 52 percent. In other words, companies that typically rely on external rewards to manage their employees run some of their most important systems with products created by nonemployees who don't seem to need such rewards. And it's not just the tens of thousands of software projects across the globe. Today you can find: open-source cookbooks; open-source textbooks; open-source car design; open-source medical research; open-source legal briefs; open-source stock photography; open-source prosthetics; open-source credit unions; open-source cola; and for those for whom soft drinks won't suffice, open-source beer. This new way of organizing what we do doesn't banish extrinsic rewards. People in the open-source movement haven't taken vows of poverty. For many, participation in these projects can burnish their reputations and sharpen their skills, which can enhance their earning power. Entrepreneurs have launched new, and sometimes lucrative, companies to help organizations implement and maintain open-source software applications. But ultimately, open source depends on intrinsic motivation with the same ferocity that older business models rely on extrinsic motivation, as several scholars have shown. MIT management professor Karim Lakhani and Boston Consulting Group consultant Bob Wolf surveyed 684 open-source developers, mostly in North America and Europe, about why they participated in these projects. Lakhani and Wolf uncovered a range of motives, but they found that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. A large majority of programmers, the researchers discovered, reported that they frequently reached the state of optimal challenge called flow. Likewise, three German economists who studied open-source projects around the world found that what drives participants is a set of predominantly intrinsic motives in particular, the fun . . . of mastering the challenge of a given software problem and the desire to give a gift to the programmer community. Motivation 2.0 has little room for these sorts of impulses. What's more, open source is only one way people are restructuring what they do along new organizational lines and atop different motivational ground. Let's move from software code to the legal code. The laws in most developed countries permit essentially two types of business organizations profit and nonprofit. One makes money, the other does good. And the most prominent member of that first category is the publicly held corporation owned by shareholders and run by managers who are overseen by a board of directors. The managers and directors bear one overriding responsibility: to maximize shareholder gain. Other types of business organizations steer by the same rules of the road. In the United States, for instance, partnerships, S corporations, C corporations, limited liability corporations, and other business configurations all aim toward a common end. The objective of those who run them practically, legally, in some ways morally is to maximize profit. Let me give a rousing, heartfelt, and grateful cheer for these business forms and the farsighted countries that enable their citizens to create them. Without them, our lives would be infinitely less prosperous, less healthy, and less happy. But in the last few years, several people around the world have been changing the recipe and cooking up new varieties of business organizations. For example, in April 2008, Vermont became the first U.S. state to allow a new type of business called the low-profit limited liability corporation. Dubbed an L3C, this entity is a corporation but not as we typically think of it. As one report explained, an L3C operate[s] like a for-profit business generating at least modest profits, but its primary aim [is] to offer significant social benefits. Three other U.S. states have followed Vermont's lead. An L3C in North Carolina, for instance, is buying abandoned furniture factories in the state, updating them with green technology, and leasing them back to beleaguered furniture manufacturers at a low rate. The venture hopes to make money, but its real purpose is to help revitalize a struggling region. Meanwhile, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus has begun creating what he calls social businesses. These are companies that raise capital, develop products, and sell them in an open market but do so in the service of a larger social mission or as he puts it, with the profit-maximization principle replaced by the social-benefit principle. The Fourth Sector Network in the United States and Denmark is promoting the for-benefit organization a hybrid that it says represents a new category of organization that is both economically self-sustaining and animated by a public purpose. One example: Mozilla, the entity that gave us Firefox, is organized as a for-benefit organization. And three U.S. entrepreneurs have invented the B Corporation, a designation that requires companies to amend their bylaws so that the incentives favor long-term value and social impact instead of short-term economic gain. Neither open-source production nor previously unimagined not only for profit businesses are yet the norm, of course. And they won't consign the public corporation to the trash heap. But their emergence tells us something important about where we're heading. There's a big movement out there that is not yet recognized as a movement, a lawyer who specializes in for-benefit organizations told The New York Times. One reason could be that traditional businesses are profit maximizers, which square perfectly with Motivation 2.0. These new entities are purpose maximizers which are unsuited to this older operating system because they flout its very principles. How We Think About What We Do When I took my first economics course back in the early 1980s, our professor a brilliant lecturer with a Patton-like stage presence offered an important clarification before she'd chalked her first indifference curve on the blackboard. Economics, she explained, wasn't the study of money. It was the study of behavior. In the course of a day, each of us was constantly figuring the cost and benefits of our actions and then deciding how to act. Economists studied what people did, rather than what we said, because we did what was best for us. We were rational calculators of our economic self-interest. When I studied law a few years later, a similar idea reappeared. The newly ascendant field of law and economics held that precisely because we were such awesome self-interest calculators, laws and regulations often impeded, rather than permitted, sensible and just outcomes. I survived law school in no small part because I discovered the talismanic phrase and offered it on exams: In a world of perfect information and low transaction costs, the parties will bargain to a wealth-maximizing result. Then, about a decade later, came a curious turn of events that made me question much of what I'd worked hard, and taken on enormous debt, to learn. In 2002, the Nobel Foundation awarded its prize in economics to a guy who wasn't even an economist. And they gave him the field's highest honor largely for revealing that we weren't always rational calculators of our economic self-interest and that the parties often didn't bargain to a wealth-maximizing result. Daniel Kahneman, an American psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in economics that year for work he'd done with Israeli Amos Tversky, helped force a change in how we think about what we do. And one of the implications of this new way of thinking is that it calls into question many of the assumptions of Motivation 2.0. Kahneman and others in the field of behavioral economics agreed with my professor that economics was the study of human economic behavior. They just believed that we'd placed too much emphasis on the economic and not enough on the human . That hyperrational calculator-brained person wasn't real. He was a convenient fiction. Play a game with me and I'll try to illustrate the point. Suppose somebody gives me ten dollars and tells me to share it some, all, or none with you. If you accept my offer, we both get to keep the money. If you reject it, neither of us gets anything. If I offered you six dollars (keeping four for myself ), would you take it? Almost certainly. If I offered you five, you'd probably take that, too. But what if I offered you two dollars? Would you take it? In an experiment replicated around the world, most people rejected offers of two dollars and below. That makes no sense in terms of wealth maximization. If you take my offer of two dollars, you're two dollars richer. If you reject it, you get nothing. Your cognitive calculator knows two is greater than zero but because you're a human being, your notions of fair play or your desire for revenge or your simple irritation overrides it. In real life our behavior is far more complex than the textbook allows and often confounds the idea that we're purely rational. We don't save enough for retirement even though it's to our clear economic advantage to do so. We hang on to bad investments longer than we should, because we feel far sharper pain from losing money than we do from gaining the exact same amount. Give us a choice of two television sets, we'll pick one; toss in an irrelevant third choice, and we'll pick the other. In short, we are irrational and predictably so, says economist Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational , a book that offers an entertaining and engaging overview of behavioral economics. The trouble for our purposes is that Motivation 2.0 assumes we're the same robotic wealth-maximizers I was taught we were a couple of decades ago. Indeed, the very premise of extrinsic incentives is that we'll always respond rationally to them. But even most economists don't believe that anymore. Sometimes these motivators work. Often they don't. And many times, they inflict collateral damage. In short, the new way economists think about what we do is hard to reconcile with Motivation 2.0. What's more, if people do things for lunk-headed, backward-looking reasons, why wouldn't we also do things for significance-seeking, self-actualizing reasons? If we're predictably irrational and we clearly are why couldn't we also be predictably transcendent? If that seems far-fetched, consider some of our other bizarre behaviors. We leave lucrative jobs to take low-paying ones that provide a clearer sense of purpose. We work to master the clarinet on weekends although we have little hope of making a dime (Motivation 2.0) or acquiring a mate (Motivation 1.0) from doing so. We play with puzzles even when we don't get a few raisins or dollars for solving them. Some scholars are already widening the reach of behavioral economics to encompass these ideas. The most prominent is Bruno Frey, an economist at the University of Zurich. Like the behavioral economists, he has argued that we need to move beyond the idea of Homo Oeconomicus (Economic Man, that fictional wealth-maximizing robot). But his extension goes in a slightly different direction to what he calls Homo Oeconomicus Maturus (or Mature Economic Man). This figure, he says, is more Ômature' in the sense that he is endowed with a more refined motivational structure. In other words, to fully understand human economic behavior, we have to come to terms with an idea at odds with Motivation 2.0. As Frey writes, Intrinsic motivation is of great importance for all economic activities. It is inconceivable that people are motivated solely or even mainly by external incentives. How We Do What We Do If you manage other people, take a quick glance over your shoulder. There's a ghost hovering there. His name is Frederick Winslow Taylor remember him from earlier in the chapter? and he's whispering in your ear. Work, Taylor is murmuring, consists mainly of simple, not particularly interesting, tasks. The only way to get people to do them is to incentivize them properly and monitor them carefully. In the early 1900s, Taylor had a point. Today, in much of the world, that's less true. Yes, for some people work remains routine, unchallenging, and directed by others. But for a surprisingly large number of people, jobs have become more complex, more interesting, and more self-directed. And that type of work presents a direct challenge to the assumptions of Motivation 2.0. Begin with complexity. Behavioral scientists often divide what we do on the job or learn in school into two categories: algorithmic and heuristic. An algorithmic task is one in which you follow a set of established instructions down a single pathway to one conclusion. That is, there's an algorithm for solving it. A heuristic task is the opposite. Precisely because no algorithm exists for it, you have to experiment with possibilities and devise a novel solution. Working as a grocery checkout clerk is mostly algorithmic. You do pretty much the same thing over and over in a certain way. Creating an ad campaign is mostly heuristic. You have to come up with something new. During the twentieth century, most work was algorithmic and not just jobs where you turned the same screw the same way all day long. Even when we traded blue collars for white, the tasks we carried out were often routine. That is, we could reduce much of what we did in accounting, law, computer programming, and other fields to a script, a spec sheet, a formula, or a series of steps that produced a right answer. But today, in much of North America, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, routine white-collar work is disappearing. It's racing offshore to wherever it can be done the cheapest. In India, Bulgaria, the Philippines, and other countries, lower-paid workers essentially run the algorithm, figure out the correct answer, and deliver it instantaneously from their computer to someone six thousand miles away. But offshoring is just one pressure on rule-based, left-brain work. Just as oxen and then forklifts replaced simple physical labor, computers are replacing simple intellectual labor. So while outsourcing is just beginning to pick up speed, software can already perform many rule-based, professional functions better, more quickly, and more cheaply than we can. That means that your cousin the CPA, if he's doing mostly routine work, faces competition not just from five-hundred-dollar-a-month accountants in Manila, but from tax preparation programs anyone can download for thirty dollars. The consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates that in the United States, only 30 percent of job growth now comes from algorithmic work, while 70 percent comes from heuristic work. A key reason: Routine work can be outsourced or automated; artistic, empathic, nonroutine work generally cannot. The implications for motivation are vast. Researchers such as Harvard Business School's Teresa Amabile have found that external rewards and punishments both carrots and sticks can work nicely for algorithmic tasks. But they can be devastating for heuristic ones. Those sorts of challenges solving novel problems or creating something the world didn't know it was missing depend heavily on Harlow's third drive. Amabile calls it the intrinsic motivation principle of creativity, which holds, in part: Intrinsic motivation is conducive to creativity; controlling extrinsic motivation is detrimental to creativity. In other words, the central tenets of Motivation 2.0 may actually impair performance of the heuristic, right-brain work on which modern economies depend. Partly because work has become more creative and less routine, it has also become more enjoyable. That, too, scrambles Motivation 2.0's assumptions. This operating system rests on the belief that work is not inherently enjoyable which is precisely why we must coax people with external rewards and threaten them with outside punishment. One unexpected finding of the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, whom we'll encounter in Chapter 5, is that people are much more likely to report having optimal experiences on the job than during leisure. But if work is inherently enjoyable for more and more people, then the external inducements at the heart of Motivation 2.0 become less necessary. Worse, as Deci began discovering forty years ago, adding certain kinds of extrinsic rewards on top of inherently interesting tasks can often dampen motivation and diminish performance. Once again, certain bedrock notions suddenly seem less sturdy. Take the curious example of Vocation Vacations. This is a business in which people pay their hard-earned money . . . to work at another job. They use their vacation time to test-drive being a chef, running a bike shop, or operating an animal shelter. The emergence of this and similar ventures suggests that work, which economists have always considered a disutility (something we'd avoid unless we received a payment in return), is becoming a utility (something we'd pursue even in the absence of a tangible return). Finally, because work is supposed to be dreary, Motivation 2.0 holds that people need to be carefully monitored so they don't shirk. This idea, too, is becoming less relevant and, in many ways, less possible. Consider, for instance, that America alone now has more than 18 million of what the U.S. Census Bureau calls non-employer businesses businesses without any paid employees. Since people in these businesses don't have any underlings, they don't have anybody to manage or motivate. But since they don't have bosses themselves, there's nobody to manage or motivate them. They have to be self-directed. So do people who aren't technically working for themselves. In the United States, 33.7 million people telecommute at least one day a month, and 14.7 million do so every day placing a substantial portion of the workforce beyond the gaze of a manager, forcing them to direct their own work. And even if many organizations haven't opted for measures like these, they're generally becoming leaner and less hierarchical. In an effort to reduce costs, they trim the fatty middle. That means managers oversee larger numbers of people and therefore scrutinize each one less closely. As organizations flatten, companies need people who are self-motivated. That forces many organizations to become more like, er, Wikipedia. Nobody manages the Wikipedians. Nobody sits around trying to figure out how to motivate them. That's why Wikipedia works. Routine, not-so-interesting jobs require direction; nonroutine, more interesting work depends on self-direction. One business leader, who didn't want to be identified, said it plainly. When he conducts job interviews, he tells prospective employees: If you need me to motivate you, I probably don't want to hire you. TO RECAP, Motivation 2.0 suffers from three compatibility problems. It doesn't mesh with the way many new business models are organizing what we do because we're intrinsically motivated purpose maximizers, not only extrinsically motivated profit maximizers. It doesn't comport with the way that twenty-first-century economics thinks about what we do because economists are finally realizing that we're full-fledged human beings, not single-minded economic robots. And perhaps most important, it's hard to reconcile with much of what we actually do at work because for growing numbers of people, work is often creative, interesting, and self-directed rather than unrelentingly routine, boring, and other-directed. Taken together, these compatibility problems warn us that something's gone awry in our motivational operating system. But in order to figure out exactly what, and as an essential step in fashioning a new one, we need to take a look at the bugs themselves.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 2 Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work . . . A n object in motion will stay in motion, and an object at rest will stay at rest, unless acted on by an outside force. That's Newton's first law of motion. Like Newton's other laws, this one is elegant and simple which is part of its power. Even people like me, who bumbled though high school physics, can understand it and can use it to interpret the world. Motivation 2.0 is similar. At its heart are two elegant and simple ideas: Rewarding an activity will get you more of it. Punishing an activity will get you less of it. And just as Newton's principles can help us explain our physical environment or chart the path of a thrown ball, Motivation 2.0's principles can help us comprehend our social surroundings and predict the trajectory of human behavior. But Newtonian physics runs into problems at the subatomic level. Down there in the land of hadrons, quarks, and Schršdinger's cat things get freaky. The cool rationality of Isaac Newton gives way to the bizarre unpredictability of Lewis Carroll. Motivation 2.0 is similar in this regard, too. When rewards and punishments encounter our third drive, something akin to behavioral quantum mechanics seems to take over and strange things begin to happen. Of course, the starting point for any discussion of motivation in the workplace is a simple fact of life: People have to earn a living. Salary, contract payments, some benefits, a few perks are what I call baseline rewards. If someone's baseline rewards aren't adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation and the anxiety of her circumstance. You'll get neither the predictability of extrinsic motivation nor the weirdness of intrinsic motivation. You'll get very little motivation at all. But once we're past that threshold, carrots and sticks can achieve precisely the opposite of their intended aims. Mechanisms designed to increase motivation can dampen it. Tactics aimed at boosting creativity can reduce it. Programs to promote good deeds can make them disappear. Meanwhile, instead of restraining negative behavior, rewards and punishments can often set it loose and give rise to cheating, addiction, and dangerously myopic thinking. This is weird. And it doesn't hold in all circumstances (about which more after this chapter). But as Edward Deci's Soma puzzle experiment demonstrates, many practices whose effectiveness we take for granted produce counterintuitive results: They can give us less of what we want and more of what we don't want. These are the bugs in Motivation 2.0. And they rise to the surface whether we're promising rupees in India, charging shekels in Israel, drawing blood in Sweden, or painting portraits in Chicago. LESS OF WHAT WE WANT O ne of the most enduring scenes in American literature offers an important lesson in human motivation. In Chapter 2 of Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , Tom faces the dreary task of whitewashing Aunt Polly's 810-square-foot fence. He's not exactly thrilled with the assignment. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden, Twain writes. But just when Tom has nearly lost hope, nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration bursts upon him. When his friend Ben ambles by and mocks Tom for his sorry lot, Tom acts confused. Slapping paint on a fence isn't a grim chore, he says. It's a fantastic privilege a source of, ahem, intrinsic motivation. The job is so captivating that when Ben asks to try a few brushstrokes himself, Tom refuses. He doesn't relent until Ben gives up his apple in exchange for the opportunity. Soon more boys arrive, all of whom tumble into Tom's trap and end up whitewashing the fence several times over on his behalf. From this episode, Twain extracts a key motivational principle, namely that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. He goes on to write: There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign. In other words, rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioral alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge. They can turn play into work. And by diminishing intrinsic motivation, they can send performance, creativity, and even upstanding behavior toppling like dominoes. Let's call this the Sawyer Effect. A sampling of intriguing experiments around the world reveals the four realms where this effect kicks in and shows yet again the mismatch between what science knows and what business does. Intrinsic Motivation Behavioral scientists like Deci began discovering the Sawyer Effect nearly forty years ago, although they didn't use that term. Instead, they referred to the counterintuitive consequences of extrinsic incentives as the hidden costs of rewards. That, in fact, was the title of the first book on the subject a 1978 research volume that was edited by psychologists Mark Lepper and David Greene. One of Lepper and Greene's early studies (which they carried out with a third colleague, Robert Nisbett) has become a classic in the field and among the most cited articles in the motivation literature. The three researchers watched a classroom of preschoolers for several days and identified the children who chose to spend their free play time drawing. Then they fashioned an experiment to test the effect of rewarding an activity these children clearly enjoyed. The researchers divided the children into three groups. The first was the expected-award group. They showed each of these children a Good Player certificate adorned with a blue ribbon and featuring the child's name and asked if the child wanted to draw in order to receive the award. The second group was the unexpected-award group. Researchers asked these children simply if they wanted to draw. If they decided to, when the session ended, the researchers handed each child one of the Good Player certificates. The third group was the no-award group. Researchers asked these children if they wanted to draw, but neither promised them a certificate at the beginning nor gave them one at the end. Two weeks later, back in the classroom, teachers set out paper and markers during the preschool's free play period while the researchers secretly observed the students. Children previously in the unexpected-award and no-award groups drew just as much, and with the same relish, as they had before the experiment. But children in the first group the ones who'd expected and then received an award showed much less interest and spent much less time drawing. The Sawyer Effect had taken hold. Even two weeks later, those alluring prizes so common in classrooms and cubicles had turned play into work. To be clear, it wasn't necessarily the rewards themselves that dampened the children's interest. Remember: When children didn't expect a reward, receiving one had little impact on their intrinsic motivation. Only contingent rewards if you do this, then you'll get that had the negative effect. Why? If-then rewards require people to forfeit some of their autonomy. Like the gentlemen driving carriages for money instead of fun, they're no longer fully controlling their lives. And that can spring a hole in the bottom of their motivational bucket, draining an activity of its enjoyment. Lepper and Greene replicated these results in several subsequent experiments with children. As time went on, other researchers found similar results with adults. Over and over again, they discovered that extrinsic rewards in particular, contingent, expected, if-then rewards snuffed out the third drive. These insights proved so controversial after all, they called into question a standard practice of most companies and schools that in 1999 Deci and two colleagues reanalyzed nearly three decades of studies on the subject to confirm the findings. Careful consideration of reward effects reported in 128 experiments lead to the conclusion that tangible rewards tend to have a substantially negative effect on intrinsic motivation, they determined. When institutions families, schools, businesses, and athletic teams, for example focus on the short-term and opt for controlling people's behavior, they do considerable long-term damage. Try to encourage a kid to learn math by paying her for each work-book page she completes and she'll almost certainly become more diligent in the short term and lose interest in math in the long term. Take an industrial designer who loves his work and try to get him to do better by making his pay contingent on a hit product and he'll almost certainly work like a maniac in the short term, but become less interested in his job in the long term. As one leading behavioral science textbook puts it, People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person's motivation and behavior, but in so doing, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining that person's intrinsic motivation toward the activity. This is one of the most robust findings in social science and also one of the most ignored. Despite the work of a few skilled and passionate popularizers in particular, Alfie Kohn, whose prescient 1993 book, Punished by Rewards , lays out a devastating indictment of extrinsic incentives we persist in trying to motivate people this way. Perhaps we're scared to let go of Motivation 2.0, despite its obvious downsides. Perhaps we can't get our minds around the peculiar quantum mechanics of intrinsic motivation. Or perhaps there's a better reason. Even if those controlling if-then rewards activate the Sawyer Effect and suffocate the third drive, maybe they actually get people to perform better. If that's the case, perhaps they're not so bad. So let's ask: Do extrinsic rewards boost performance? Four economists went to India to find out. High Performance One of the difficulties of laboratory experiments that test the impact of extrinsic motivators like cash is the cost. If you're going to pay people to perform, you have to pay them a meaningful amount. And in the United States or Europe, where standards of living are high, an individually meaningful amount multiplied by dozens of participants can rack up unsustainably large bills for behavioral scientists. In part to circumvent this problem, a quartet of economists including Dan Ariely, whom I mentioned in the last chapter set up shop in Madurai, India, to gauge the effects of extrinsic incentives on performance. Because the cost of living in rural India is much lower than in North America, the researchers could offer large rewards without breaking their own banks. They recruited eighty-seven participants and asked them to play several games for example, tossing tennis balls at a target, unscrambling anagrams, recalling a string of digits that required motor skills, creativity, or concentration. To test the power of incentives, the experimenters offered three types of rewards for reaching certain performance levels. One-third of the participants could earn a small reward 4 rupees (at the time worth around 50 U.S. cents and equal to about a day's pay in Madurai) for reaching their performance targets. One-third could earn a medium reward 40 rupees (about $5, or two weeks' pay). And one-third could earn a very large reward 400 rupees (about $50, or nearly five months' pay). What happened? Did the size of the reward predict the quality of the performance? Yes. But not in the way you might expect. As it turned out, the people offered the medium-sized bonus didn't perform any better than those offered the small one. And those in the 400-rupee super-incentivized group? They fared worst of all. By nearly every measure, they lagged behind both the low-reward and medium-reward participants. Reporting the results for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the researchers wrote, In eight of the nine tasks we examined across the three experiments, higher incentives led to worse performance. Let's circle back to this conclusion for a moment. Four economists two from MIT, one from Carnegie Mellon, and one from the University of Chicago undertake research for the Federal Reserve System, one of the most powerful economic actors in the world. But instead of affirming a simple business principle higher rewards lead to higher performance they seem to refute it. And it's not just American researchers reaching these counterintuitive conclusions. In 2009, scholars at the London School of Economics alma mater of eleven Nobel laureates in economics analyzed fifty-one studies of corporate pay-for-performance plans. These economists' conclusion: We find that financial incentives . . . can result in a negative impact on overall performance. On both sides of the Atlantic, the gap between what science is learning and what business is doing is wide. Many existing institutions provide very large incentives for exactly the type of tasks we used here, Ariely and his colleagues wrote. Our results challenge [that] assumption. Our experiment suggests . . . that one cannot assume that introducing or raising incentives always improves performance. Indeed, in many instances, contingent incentives that cornerstone of how businesses attempt to motivate employees may be a losing proposition. Of course, procrastinating writers notwithstanding, few of us spend our working hours flinging tennis balls or doing anagrams. How about the more creative tasks that are more akin to what we actually do on the job? Creativity For a quick test of problem-solving prowess, few exercises are more useful than the candle problem. Devised by psychologist Karl Duncker in the 1930s, the candle problem is used in a wide variety of experiments in behavioral science. Follow along and see how you do. You sit at a table next to a wooden wall and the experimenter gives you the materials shown below: a candle, some tacks, and a book of matches. The candle problem presented. Your job is to attach the candle to the wall so that the wax doesn't drip on the table. Think for a moment about how you'd solve the problem. Many people begin by trying to tack the candle to the wall. But that doesn't work. Some light a match, melt the side of the candle, and try to adhere it to the wall. That doesn't work either. But after five or ten minutes, most people stumble onto the solution, which you can see below. The candle problem solved. The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness. You look at the box and see only one function as a container for the tacks. But by thinking afresh, you eventually see that the box can have another function as a platform for the candle. To reprise language from the previous chapter, the solution isn't algorithmic (following a set path) but heuristic (breaking from the path to discover a novel strategy). What happens when you give people a conceptual challenge like this and offer them rewards for speedy solutions? Sam Glucksberg, a psychologist now at Princeton University, tested this a few decades ago by timing how quickly two groups of participants solved the candle problem. He told the first group that he was timing their work merely to establish norms for how long it typically took someone to complete this sort of puzzle. To the second group he offered incentives. If a participant's time was among the fastest 25 percent of all the people being tested, that participant would receive $5. If the participant's time was the fastest of all, the reward would be $20. Adjusted for inflation, those are decent sums of money for a few minutes of effort a nice motivator. How much faster did the incentivized group come up with a solution? On average, it took them nearly three and a half minutes longer . Yes, three and a half minutes longer. (Whenever I've relayed these results to a group of businesspeople, the reaction is almost always a loud, pained, involuntary gasp.) In direct contravention to the core tenets of Motivation 2.0, an incentive designed to clarify thinking and sharpen creativity ended up clouding thinking and dulling creativity. Why? Rewards, by their very nature, narrow our focus. That's helpful when there's a clear path to a solution. They help us stare ahead and race faster. But if-then motivators are terrible for challenges like the candle problem. As this experiment shows, the rewards narrowed people's focus and blinkered the wide view that might have allowed them to see new uses for old objects. Something similar seems to occur for challenges that aren't so much about cracking an existing problem but about iterating something new. Teresa Amabile, the Harvard Business School professor and one of the world's leading researchers on creativity, has frequently tested the effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. In one study, she and two colleagues recruited twenty-three professional artists from the United States who had produced both commissioned and noncommissioned artwork. They asked the artists to randomly select ten commissioned works and ten noncommissioned works. Then Amabile and her team gave the works to a panel of accomplished artists and curators, who knew nothing about the study, and asked the experts to rate the pieces on creativity and technical skill. Our results were quite startling, the researchers wrote. The commissioned works were rated as significantly less creative than the non-commissioned works, yet they were not rated as different in technical quality. Moreover, the artists reported feeling significantly more constrained when doing commissioned works than when doing non-commissioned works. One artist whom they interviewed describes the Sawyer Effect in action: Not always, but a lot of the time, when you are doing a piece for someone else it becomes more work than joy. When I work for myself there is the pure joy of creating and I can work through the night and not even know it. On a commissioned piece you have to check yourself be careful to do what the client wants. Another study of artists over a longer period shows that a concern for outside rewards might actually hinder eventual success. In the early 1960s, researchers surveyed sophomores and juniors at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago about their attitudes toward work and whether they were more intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. Using these data as a benchmark, another researcher followed up with these students in the early 1980s to see how their careers were progressing. Among the starkest findings, especially for men: The less evidence of extrinsic motivation during art school, the more success in professional art both several years after graduation and nearly twenty years later. Painters and sculptors who were intrinsically motivated, those for whom the joy of discovery and the challenge of creation were their own rewards, were able to weather the tough times and the lack of remuneration and recognition that inevitably accompany artistic careers. And that led to yet another paradox in the Alice in Wonderland world of the third drive. Those artists who pursued their painting and sculpture more for the pleasure of the activity itself than for extrinsic rewards have produced art that has been socially recognized as superior, the study said. It is those who are least motivated to pursue extrinsic rewards who eventually receive them. This result is not true across all tasks, of course. Amabile and others have found that extrinsic rewards can be effective for algorithmic tasks those that depend on following an existing formula to its logical conclusion. But for more right-brain undertakings those that demand flexible problem-solving, inventiveness, or conceptual understanding contingent rewards can be dangerous. Rewarded subjects often have a harder time seeing the periphery and crafting original solutions. This, too, is one of the sturdiest findings in social science especially as Amabile and others have refined it over the years. For artists, scientists, inventors, schoolchildren, and the rest of us, intrinsic motivation the drive do something because it is interesting, challenging, and absorbing is essential for high levels of creativity. But the if-then motivators that are the staple of most businesses often stifle, rather than stir, creative thinking. As the economy moves toward more right-brain, conceptual work as more of us deal with our own versions of the candle problem this might be the most alarming gap between what science knows and what business does. Good Behavior Philosophers and medical professionals have long debated whether blood donors should be paid. Some claim that blood, like human tissue or organs, is special that we shouldn't be able to buy and sell it like a barrel of crude oil or a crate of ball bearings. Others argue that we should shelve our squeamishness, because paying for this substance will ensure an ample supply. But in 1970, British sociologist Richard Titmuss, who had studied blood donation in the United Kingdom, offered a bolder speculation. Paying for blood wasn't just immoral, he said. It was also inefficient. If Britain decided to pay citizens to donate, that would actually reduce the country's blood supply. It was an oddball notion, to be sure. Economists snickered. And Titmuss never tested the idea; it was merely a philosophical hunch. But a quarter-century later, two Swedish economists decided to see if Titmuss was right. In an intriguing field experiment, they visited a regional blood center in Gothenburg and found 153 women who were interested in giving blood. Then as seems to be the custom among motivation researchers they divided the women into three groups. Experimenters told those in the first group that blood donation was voluntary. These participants could give blood, but they wouldn't receive a payment. The experimenters offered the second group a different arrangement. If these participants gave blood, they'd each receive 50 Swedish kronor (about $7). The third group received a variation on that second offer: a 50-kronor payment with an immediate option to donate the amount to a children's cancer charity. Of the first group, 52 percent of the women decided to go ahead and donate blood. They were altruistic citizens apparently, willing to do a good deed for their fellow Swedes even in the absence of compensation. And the second group? Motivation 2.0 would suggest that this group might be a bit more motivated to donate. They'd shown up, which indicated intrinsic motivation. Getting a few kronor on top might give that impulse a boost. But as you might have guessed by now that's not what happened. In this group, only 30 percent of the women decided to give blood. Instead of increasing the number of blood donors, offering to pay people decreased the number by nearly half. Meanwhile, the third group which had the option of donating the fee directly to charity responded much the same as the first group. Fifty-three percent became blood donors. Titmuss's hunch might have been right, after all. Adding a monetary incentive didn't lead to more of the desired behavior. It led to less. The reason: It tainted an altruistic act and crowded out the intrinsic desire to do something good. Doing good is what blood donation is all about. It provides what the American Red Cross brochures say is a feeling that money can't buy. That's why voluntary blood donations invariably increase during natural disasters and other calamities. But if governments were to pay people to help their neighbors during these crises, donations might decline. That said, in the Swedish example, the reward itself wasn't inherently destructive. The immediate option to donate the 50-kronor payment rather than pocket it seemed to negate the effect. This, too, is extremely important. It's not that all rewards at all times are bad. For instance, when the Italian government gave blood donors paid time off work, donations increased. The law removed an obstacle to altruism. So while a few advocates would have you believe in the basic evil of extrinsic incentives, that's just not empirically true. What is true is that mixing rewards with inherently interesting, creative, or noble tasks deploying them without understanding the peculiar science of motivation is a very dangerous game. When used in these situations, if-then rewards usually do more harm than good. By neglecting the ingredients of genuine motivation autonomy, mastery, and purpose they limit what each of us can achieve. MORE OF WHAT WE DON'T WANT I n the upside-down universe of the third drive, rewards can often produce less of the very things they're trying to encourage. But that's not the end of the story. When used improperly, extrinsic motivators can have another unintended collateral consequence: They can give us more of what we don't want. Here, again, what business does hasn't caught up with what science knows. And what science is revealing is that carrots and sticks can promote bad behavior, create addiction, and encourage short-term thinking at the expense of the long view. Unethical Behavior What could be more valuable than having a goal? From our earliest days, teachers, coaches, and parents advise us to set goals and to work mightily to achieve them and with good reason. Goals work. The academic literature shows that by helping us tune out distractions, goals can get us to try harder, work longer, and achieve more. But recently a group of scholars from the Harvard Business School, Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the University of Arizona's Eller College of Management, and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School questioned the efficacy of this broad prescription. Rather than being offered as an Ôover-the-counter' salve for boosting performance, goal setting should be prescribed selectively, presented with a warning label, and closely monitored, they wrote. Goals that people set for themselves and that are devoted to attaining mastery are usually healthy. But goals imposed by others sales targets, quarterly returns, standardized test scores, and so on can sometimes have dangerous side effects. Like all extrinsic motivators, goals narrow our focus. That's one reason they can be effective; they concentrate the mind. But as we've seen, a narrowed focus exacts a cost. For complex or conceptual tasks, offering a reward can blinker the wide-ranging thinking necessary to come up with an innovative solution. Likewise, when an extrinsic goal is paramount particularly a short-term, measurable one whose achievement delivers a big payoff its presence can restrict our view of the broader dimensions of our behavior. As the cadre of business school professors write, Substantial evidence demonstrates that in addition to motivating constructive effort, goal setting can induce unethical behavior. The examples are legion, the researchers note. Sears imposes a sales quota on its auto repair staff and workers respond by overcharging customers and completing unnecessary repairs. Enron sets lofty revenue goals and the race to meet them by any means possible catalyzes the company's collapse. Ford is so intent on producing a certain car at a certain weight at a certain price by a certain date that it omits safety checks and unleashes the dangerous Ford Pinto. The problem with making an extrinsic reward the only destination that matters is that some people will choose the quickest route there, even if it means taking the low road. Indeed, most of the scandals and misbehavior that have seemed endemic to modern life involve shortcuts. Executives game their quarterly earnings so they can snag a performance bonus. Secondary school counselors doctor student transcripts so their seniors can get into college. Athletes inject themselves with steroids to post better numbers and trigger lucrative performance bonuses. Contrast that approach with behavior sparked by intrinsic motivation. When the reward is the activity itself deepening learning, delighting customers, doing one's best there are no shortcuts. The only route to the destination is the high road. In some sense, it's impossible to act unethically because the person who's disadvantaged isn't a competitor but yourself. Of course, all goals are not created equal. And let me emphasize this point goals and extrinsic rewards aren't inherently corrupting. But goals are more toxic than Motivation 2.0 recognizes. In fact, the business school professors suggest they should come with their own warning label: Goals may cause systematic problems for organizations due to narrowed focus, unethical behavior, increased risk taking, decreased cooperation, and decreased intrinsic motivation. Use care when applying goals in your organization. If carrots-as-goals sometimes encourage unworthy behavior, then sticks-as-punishment should be able to halt it, right? Not so fast. The third drive is less mechanistic and more surprising than that, as two Israeli economists discovered at some day care centers. In 2000, economists Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini studied a group of child care facilities in Haifa, Israel, for twenty weeks. The centers opened at 7:30 A.M. and closed at 4:00 P.M. Parents had to retrieve their children by the closing time or a teacher would have to stay late. During the first four weeks of the experiment, the economists recorded how many parents arrived late each week. Then, before the fifth week, with the permission of the day care centers, they posted the following sign: ANNOUNCEMENT: FINE FOR COMING LATE As you all know, the official closing time of the day care center is 1600 every day. Since some parents have been coming late, we (with the approval of the Authority for Private Day-Care Centers in Israel) have decided to impose a fine on parents who come late to pick up their children. As of next Sunday a fine of NS 10 will be charged every time a child is collected after 1610. This fine will be calculated monthly, it is to be paid together with the regular monthly payment. Sincerely, The manager of the day-care center The theory underlying the fine, said Gneezy and Rustichini, was straightforward: When negative consequences are imposed on a behavior, they will produce a reduction of that particular response. In other words, thwack the parents with a fine, and they'll stop showing up late. But that's not what happened. After the introduction of the fine we observed a steady increase in the number of parents coming late, the economists wrote. The rate finally settled, at a level that was higher, and almost twice as large as the initial one. And in language reminiscent of Harry Harlow's head scratching, they write that the existing literature didn't account for such a result. Indeed, the possibility of an increase in the behavior being punished was not even considered. Up pops another bug in Motivation 2.0. One reason most parents showed up on time is that they had a relationship with the teachers who, after all, were caring for their precious sons and daughters and wanted to treat them fairly. Parents had an intrinsic desire to be scrupulous about punctuality. But the threat of a fine like the promise of the kronor in the blood experiment edged aside that third drive. The fine shifted the parents' decision from a partly moral obligation (be fair to my kids' teachers) to a pure transaction (I can buy extra time). There wasn't room for both. The punishment didn't promote good behavior; it crowded it out. Addiction If some scientists believe that if-then motivators and other extrinsic rewards resemble prescription drugs that carry potentially dangerous side effects, others believe they're more like illegal drugs that foster a deeper and more pernicious dependency. According to these scholars, cash rewards and shiny trophies can provide a delicious jolt of pleasure at first, but the feeling soon dissipates and to keep it alive, the recipient requires ever larger and more frequent doses. The Russian economist Anton Suvorov has constructed an elaborate econometric model to demonstrate this effect, configured around what's called principal-agent theory. Think of the principal as the motivat or the employer, the teacher, the parent. Think of the agent as the motivat ee the employee, the student, the child. A principal essentially tries to get the agent to do what the principal wants, while the agent balances his own interests with whatever the principal is offering. Using a blizzard of complicated equations that test a variety of scenarios between principal and agent, Suvorov has reached conclusions that make intuitive sense to any parent who's tried to get her kids to empty the garbage. By offering a reward, a principal signals to the agent that the task is undesirable. (If the task were desirable, the agent wouldn't need a prod.) But that initial signal, and the reward that goes with it, forces the principal onto a path that's difficult to leave. Offer too small a reward and the agent won't comply. But offer a reward that's enticing enough to get the agent to act the first time, and the principal is doomed to give it again in the second. There's no going back. Pay your son to take out the trash and you've pretty much guaranteed the kid will never do it again for free. What's more, once the initial money buzz tapers off, you'll likely have to increase the payment to continue compliance. As Suvorov explains, Rewards are addictive in that once offered, a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced, which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again. And before long, the existing reward may no longer suffice. It will quickly feel less like a bonus and more like the status quo which then forces the principal to offer larger rewards to achieve the same effect. This addictive pattern is not merely blackboard theory. Brian Knutson, then a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, demonstrated as much in an experiment using the brain scanning technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). He placed healthy volunteers into a giant scanner to watch how their brains responded during a game that involved the prospect of either winning or losing money. When participants knew they had a chance to win cash, activation occurred in the part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. That is, when the participants anticipated getting a reward (but not when they anticipated losing one), a burst of the brain chemical dopamine surged to this part of the brain. Knutson, who is now at Stanford University, has found similar results in subsequent studies where people anticipated rewards. What makes this response interesting for our purposes is that the same basic physiological process this particular brain chemical surging to this particular part of the brain is what happens in addiction. The mechanism of most addictive drugs is to send a fusillade of dopamine to the nucleus accumbens. The feeling delights, then dissipates, then demands another dose. In other words, if we watch how people's brains respond, promising them monetary rewards and giving them cocaine, nicotine, or amphetamines look disturbingly similar. This could be one reason that paying people to stop smoking often works in the short run. It replaces one (dangerous) addiction with another (more benign) one. Rewards' addictive qualities can also distort decision-making. Knutson has found that activation in the nucleus accumbens seems to predict both risky choices and risk-seeking mistakes. Get people fired up with the prospect of rewards, and instead of making better decisions, as Motivation 2.0 hopes, they can actually make worse ones. As Knutson writes, This may explain why casinos surround their guests with reward cues (e.g., inexpensive food, free liquor, surprise gifts, potential jackpot prizes) anticipation of rewards activates the [nucleus accumbens], which may lead to an increase in the likelihood of individuals switching from risk-averse to risk-seeking behavior. In short, while that dangled carrot isn't all bad in all circumstances, in some instances it operates similar to a rock of crack cocaine and can induce behavior similar to that found around the craps table or roulette wheel not exactly what we hope to achieve when we motivate our teammates and coworkers. Short-Term Thinking Think back to the candle problem again. The incentivized participants performed worse than their counterparts because they were so focused on the prize that they failed to glimpse a novel solution on the periphery. Rewards, we've seen, can limit the breadth of our thinking. But extrinsic motivators especially tangible, if-then ones can also reduce the depth of our thinking. They can focus our sights on only what's immediately before us rather than what's off in the distance. Many times a concentrated focus makes sense. If your office building is on fire, you want to find an exit immediately rather than ponder how to rewrite the zoning regulations. But in less dramatic circumstances, fixating on an immediate reward can damage performance over time. Indeed, what our earlier examples unethical actions and addictive behavior have in common, perhaps more than anything else, is that they're entirely short-term. Addicts want the quick fix regardless of the eventual harm. Cheaters want the quick win regardless of the lasting consequences. Yet even when the behavior doesn't devolve into shortcuts or addiction, the near-term allure of rewards can be harmful in the long run. Consider publicly held companies. Many such companies have existed for decades and hope to exist for decades more. But much of what their executives and middle managers do each day is aimed single-mindedly at the corporation's performance over the next three months. At these companies, quarterly earnings are an obsession. Executives devote substantial resources to making sure the earnings come out just right. And they spend considerable time and brain-power offering guidance to stock analysts so that the market knows what to expect and therefore responds favorably. This laser focus on a narrow, near-term slice of corporate performance is understandable. It's a rational response to stock markets that reward or punish tiny blips in those numbers, which, in turn, affect executives' compensation. But companies pay a steep price for not extending their gaze beyond the next quarter. Several researchers have found that companies that spend the most time offering guidance on quarterly earnings deliver significantly lower long-term growth rates than companies that offer guidance less frequently. (One reason: The earnings-obsessed companies typically invest less in research and development.) They successfully achieve their short-term goals, but threaten the health of the company two or three years hence. As the scholars who warned about goals gone wild put it, The very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on short-term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long-term effects on the organization. Perhaps nowhere is this clearer than in the economic calamity that gripped the world economy in 2008 and 2009. Each player in the system focused only on the short-term reward the buyer who wanted a house, the mortgage broker who wanted a commission, the Wall Street trader who wanted new securities to sell, the politician who wanted a buoyant economy during reelection and ignored the long-term effects of their actions on themselves or others. When the music stopped, the entire system nearly collapsed. This is the nature of economic bubbles: What seems to be irrational exuberance is ultimately a bad case of extrinsically motivated myopia. By contrast, the elements of genuine motivation that we'll explore later, by their very nature, defy a short-term view. Take mastery. The objective itself is inherently long-term because complete mastery, in a sense, is unattainable. Even Roger Federer, for instance, will never fully master the game of tennis. But introducing an if-then reward to help develop mastery usually backfires. That's why schoolchildren who are paid to solve problems typically choose easier problems and therefore learn less. The short-term prize crowds out the l ong-term learning. In environments where extrinsic rewards are most salient, many people work only to the point that triggers the reward and no further. So if students get a prize for reading three books, many won't pick up a fourth, let alone embark on a lifetime of reading just as executives who hit their quarterly numbers often won't boost earnings a penny more, let alone contemplate the long-term health of their company. Likewise, several studies show that paying people to exercise, stop smoking, or take their medicines produces terrific results at first but the healthy behavior disappears once the incentives are removed. However, when contingent rewards aren't involved, or when incentives are used with the proper deftness, performance improves and understanding deepens. Greatness and nearsightedness are incompatible. Meaningful achievement depends on lifting one's sights and pushing toward the horizon. CARROTS AND STICKS: The Seven Deadly Flaws 1. They can extinguish intrinsic motivation. 2.

        "text": "CHAPTER 2A . . . and the Special Circumstances When They Do C arrots and sticks aren't all bad. If they were, Motivation 2.0 would never have flourished so long or accomplished so much. While an operating system centered around rewards and punishments has outlived its usefulness and badly needs an upgrade, that doesn't mean we should scrap its every piece. Indeed, doing so would run counter to the science. The scholars exploring human motivation have revealed not only the many glitches in the traditional approach, but also the narrow band of circumstances in which carrots and sticks do their jobs reasonably well. The starting point, of course, is to ensure that the baseline rewards wages, salaries, benefits, and so on are adequate and fair. Without a healthy baseline, motivation of any sort is difficult and often impossible. But once that's established, there are circumstances where it's okay to fall back on extrinsic motivators. To understand what those circumstances are, let's return to the candle problem. In his study, Sam Glucksberg found that the participants who were offered a cash prize took longer to solve the problem than those working in a reward-free environment. The reason, you'll recall, is that the prospect of a prize narrowed participants' focus and limited their ability to see an inventive, nonobvious solution. In the same experiment, Glucksberg presented a separate set of participants with a slightly different version of the problem. Once again, he told half of them he was timing their performance to collect data and the other half that those who posted the fastest times could win cash. But he altered things just a bit. Instead of giving participants a box full of tacks, he emptied the tacks onto the desk as shown below. The candle problem presented differently. Can you guess what happened? This time, the participants vying for the reward solved the problem faster than their counterparts. Why? By removing the tacks and displaying the empty box, Glucksberg essentially revealed the solution. He transformed a challenging right-brain task into a routine left-brain one. Since participants simply had to race down an obvious path, the carrot waiting for them at the finish line encouraged them to gallop faster. Glucksberg's experiment provides the first question you should ask when contemplating external motivators: Is the task at hand routine? That is, does accomplishing it require following a prescribed set of rules to a specified end? For routine tasks, which aren't very interesting and don't demand much creative thinking, rewards can provide a small motivational booster shot without the harmful side effects. In some ways, that's just common sense. As Edward Deci, Richard Ryan, and Richard Koestner explain, Rewards do not undermine people's intrinsic motivation for dull tasks because there is little or no intrinsic motivation to be undermined. Likewise, when Dan Ariely and his colleagues conducted their Madurai, India, performance study with a group of MIT students, they found that when the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill, a larger reward led to poorer performance. But as long as the task involved only mechanical skill, bonuses worked as they would be expected: the higher the pay, the better the performance. This is extremely important. Although advanced economies now revolve less around those algorithmic, rule-based functions, some of what we do each day especially on the job still isn't all that interesting. We have TPS reports to fill out and boring e-mail to answer and all manner of drudge work that doesn't necessarily fire our soul. What's more, for some people, much of what they do all day consists of these routine, not terribly captivating, tasks. In these situations, it's best to try to unleash the positive side of the Sawyer Effect by attempting to turn work into play to increase the task's variety, to make it more like a game, or to use it to help master other skills. Alas, that's not always possible. And this means that sometimes, even if-then rewards are an option. Let's put this insight about rewards and routines into practice. Suppose you're a manager at a small nonprofit organization. Your design team created a terrific poster promoting your group's next big event. And now you need to send the poster to twenty thousand members of your organization. Since the costs of outsourcing the job to a professional mailing firm are too steep for your budget, you decide to do the work in-house. Trouble is, the posters came back from the printer much later than you expected and they need to get in the mail this weekend. What's the best way to enlist your staff of ten, and maybe a few others, in a massive weekend poster mailing session? The task is the very definition of routine: The people participating must roll up the posters, slide them into the mailing tubes, cap those tubes, and apply a mailing label and the proper postage. Four steps none of them notably interesting. One managerial option is coercion. If you're the boss, you could force people to spend their Saturday and Sunday on this mind-numbing project. They might comply, but the damage to their morale and long-term commitment could be substantial. Another option is to ask for volunteers. But face it: Most people can think of far better ways to spend a weekend. So in this case, an if-then reward might be effective. For instance, you could promise a big office-wide party if everybody pitches in on the project. You could offer a gift certificate to everyone who participates. Or you could go further and pay people a small sum for every poster they insert, enclose, and send in the hope that the piecework fee will boost their productivity. While such tangible, contingent rewards can often undermine intrinsic motivation and creativity, those drawbacks matter less here. The assignment neither inspires deep passion nor requires deep thinking. Carrots, in this case, won't hurt and might help. And you'll increase your chances of success by supplementing the poster-packing rewards with three important practices: ¥ Offer a rationale for why the task is necessary. A job that's not inherently interesting can become more meaningful, and therefore more engaging, if it's part of a larger purpose. Explain why this poster is so important and why sending it out now is critical to your organization's mission. ¥ Acknowledge that the task is boring. This is an act of empathy, of course. And the acknowledgment will help people understand why this is the rare instance when if-then rewards are part of how your organization operates. ¥ Allow people to complete the task their own way . Think autonomy, not control. State the outcome you need. But instead of specifying precisely the way to reach it how each poster must be rolled and how each mailing label must be affixed give them freedom over how they do the job. That's the approach for routine tasks. What about for other sorts of undertakings? For work that requires more than just climbing, rung by rung, up a ladder of instructions, rewards are more perilous. The best way to avoid the seven deadly flaws of extrinsic motivators is to avoid them altogether or to downplay them significantly and instead emphasize the elements of deeper motivation autonomy, mastery, and purpose that we'll explore later in the book. But in the workplace, a rigid adherence to this approach bumps up against a fact of life: Even people who do groovy, creative, right-brain work still want to be paid. And here Teresa Amabile has shed some light on how to use rewards in a way that reckons with life's realities but reduces extrinsic motivators' hidden costs. Go back to the study in which Amabile and two colleagues compared the quality of commissioned and noncommissioned paintings from a group of artists. A panel of experts, blind to what the investigators were exploring, consistently rated the noncommissioned artwork as more creative. One reason is that several artists said their commissions were constraining that they found themselves working toward a goal they didn't endorse in a manner they didn't control. However, in the same study, Amabile also discovered that when the artists considered their commissions enabling that is, the commission enabled the artist to do something interesting or exciting the creativity ranking of what they produced shot back up. The same was true for commissions the artists felt provided them with useful information and feedback about their ability. This is a crucial research insight. The science shows that it is possible though tricky to incorporate rewards into nonroutine, more creative settings without causing a cascade of damage. So suppose we're back at your nonprofit nine months later. The mailing went out flawlessly. The poster was a hit. The event was a smash. You're planning another for later this year. You've settled on the date and found your venue. Now you need an inspiring poster to captivate imaginations and draw a crowd. What should you do? Here's what you shouldn't do: Offer an if-then reward to the design staff. Do not stride into their offices and announce: If you come up with a poster that rocks my world or that boosts attendance over last year, then you'll get a ten-percent bonus. Although that motivational approach is common in organizations all over the world, it's a recipe for reduced performance. Creating a poster isn't routine. It requires conceptual, breakthrough, artistic thinking. And as we've learned, if-then rewards are an ideal way to squash this sort of thinking. Your best approach is to have already established the conditions of a genuinely motivating environment. The baseline rewards must be sufficient. That is, the team's basic compensation must be adequate and fair particularly compared with people doing similar work for similar organizations. Your nonprofit must be a congenial place to work. And the people on your team must have autonomy, they must have ample opportunity to pursue mastery, and their daily duties must relate to a larger purpose. If these elements are in place, the best strategy is to provide a sense of urgency and significance and then get out of the talent's way. But you may still be able to boost performance a bit more for future tasks than for this one through the delicate use of rewards. Just be careful. Your efforts will backfire unless the rewards you offer meet one essential requirement. And you'll be on firmer motivational footing if you follow two additional principles. The essential requirement: Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and offered only after the task is complete. Holding out a prize at the beginning of a project and offering it as a contingency will inevitably focus people's attention on obtaining the reward rather than on attacking the problem. But introducing the subject of rewards after the job is done is less risky. In other words, where if-then rewards are a mistake, shift to now that rewards as in Now that you've finished the poster and it turned out so well, I'd like to celebrate by taking you out to lunch. As Deci and his colleagues explain, If tangible rewards are given unexpectedly to people after they have finished a task, the rewards are less likely to be experienced as the reason for doing the task and are thus less likely to be detrimental to intrinsic motivation. Likewise, Amabile has found in some studies that the highest levels of creativity were produced by subjects who received a reward as a kind of a bonus. So when the poster turns out great, you could buy the design team a case of beer or even hand them a cash bonus without snuffing their creativity. The team didn't expect any extras and getting them didn't hinge on a particular outcome. You're simply offering your appreciation for their stellar work. But keep in mind one ginormous caveat: Repeated now that bonuses can quickly become expected if-then entitlements which can ultimately crater effective performance. At this point, by limiting rewards for nonroutine, creative work to the unexpected, now that variety, you're in less dangerous waters. But you'll do even better if you follow two more guidelines. First, consider nontangible rewards . Praise and positive feedback are much less corrosive than cash and trophies. In fact, in Deci's original experiments, and in his subsequent analysis of other studies, he found that positive feedback can have an enhancing effect on intrinsic motivation. So if the folks on the design team turn out a show-stopping poster, maybe just walk into their offices and say, Wow. You really did an amazing job on that poster. It's going to have a huge impact on getting people to come to this event. Thank you. It sounds small and simple, but it can have an enormous effect. Second, provide useful information . Amabile has found that while controlling extrinsic motivators can clobber creativity, informational or enabling motivators can be conducive to it. In the workplace, people are thirsting to learn about how they're doing, but only if the information isn't a tacit effort to manipulate their behavior. So don't tell the design team: That poster was perfect. You did it exactly the way I asked. Instead, give people meaningful information about their work. The more feedback focuses on specifics (great use of color) and the more the praise is about effort and strategy rather than about achieving a particular outcome the more effective it can be. In brief, for creative, right-brain, heuristic tasks, you're on shaky ground offering if-then rewards. You're better off using now that rewards. And you're best off if your now that rewards provide praise, feedback, and useful information. (For a visual depiction of this approach, see the flowchart on the next page.)

        "text": "CHAPTER 3 Type I and Type X R ochester, New York, is an unlikely epicenter for a social earthquake. The companies that built this stolid city, just sixty-two miles from the Canadian border, were titans of the industrial economy. Eastman Kodak made film. Western Union delivered telegrams. Xerox produced photocopiers. And they piloted their enterprises by the precepts of Motivation 2.0: If you offer people steady employment and carefully calibrated rewards, they'll do what executives and shareholders want, and everyone will prosper. But starting in the 1970s, on the campus of the University of Rochester, a motivational revolution was brewing. It began in 1971, when Edward Deci, fresh from his Soma puzzle experiments, arrived on campus for a joint appointment in the psychology department and the business school. It intensified in 1973, when the business school unceremoniously booted Deci because of his heretical findings about rewards, and the psychology department hired him full-time. It gathered more steam in 1975, when Deci published a book called Intrinsic Motivation . And it launched in earnest in 1977, when a student named Richard Ryan showed up for graduate school. Ryan, a philosophy major in college, had just missed being drafted into the military. Nursing a bit of survivor's guilt, he'd been working with Vietnam War veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. And he'd come to the University of Rochester to learn how to become a better clinician. One day, in a seminar, a professor brought up the subject of intrinsic motivation and then denounced it with table-pounding ferocity. I figured that if there was that much resistance, this must be something interesting, Ryan told me. He picked up a copy of Deci's book, found it compelling, and asked its author to lunch. So commenced a remarkable research collaboration that continues to this day. When I met them not long ago, in U of R's blocky Meliora Hall, the two were a study in both contrast and similarity. Deci is tall and reedy, with a pale complexion and thin, wispy hair. He speaks in a quiet, soothing voice that reminded me of the late American children's television host Mr. Rogers. Ryan, who has straight white hair parted down the middle, is ruddier and more intense. He presses his point like a skilled litigator. Deci, meanwhile, waits patiently for you to reach his point then he agrees with you and praises your insight. Deci is the classical music station on your FM dial; Ryan is more cable TV. And yet they talk to each other in a cryptic academic shorthand, their ideas smoothly in sync. The combination has been powerful enough to make them among the most influential behavioral scientists of their generation. Together Deci and Ryan have fashioned what they call self-determination theory. Many theories of behavior pivot around a particular human tendency : We're keen responders to positive and negative reinforcements, or zippy calculators of our self-interest, or lumpy duffel bags of psychosexual conflicts. SDT, by contrast, begins with a notion of universal human needs . It argues that we have three innate psychological needs competence, autonomy, and relatedness. When those needs are satisfied, we're motivated, productive, and happy. When they're thwarted, our motivation, productivity, and happiness plummet. If there's anything [fundamental] about our nature, it's the capacity for interest. Some things facilitate it. Some things undermine it, Ryan explained during one of our conversations. Put another way, we've all got that third drive. It's part of what it means to be human. But whether that aspect of our humanity emerges in our lives depends on whether the conditions around us support it. And the main mechanisms of Motivation 2.0 are more stifling than supportive. This is a really big thing in management, says Ryan. When people aren't producing, companies typically resort to rewards or punishment. What you haven't done is the hard work of diagnosing what the problem is. You're trying to run over the problem with a carrot or a stick, Ryan explains. That doesn't mean that SDT unequivocally opposes rewards. Of course, they're necessary in workplaces and other settings, says Deci. But the less salient they are made, the better. When people use rewards to motivate, that's when they're most demotivating. Instead, Deci and Ryan say we should focus our efforts on creating environments for our innate psychological needs to flourish. Over the last thirty years, through both their scholarship and mentorship, Deci and Ryan have established a network of several dozen SDT scholars conducting research in the United States, Canada, Israel, Singapore, and throughout Western Europe. These scientists have explored self-determination and intrinsic motivation in laboratory experiments and field studies that encompass just about every realm business, education, medicine, sports, exercise, personal productivity, environmentalism, relationships, and physical and mental health. They have produced hundreds of research papers, most of which point to the same conclusion. Human beings have an innate inner drive to be autonomous, self-determined, and connected to one another. And when that drive is liberated, people achieve more and live richer lives. SDT is an important part of a broad swirl of new thinking about the human condition. This constellation includes, perhaps most prominently, the positive psychology movement, which has reoriented the study of psychological science away from its previous focus on malady and dysfunction and toward well-being and effective functioning. Under the leadership of the University of Pennsylvania's Martin Seligman, positive psychology has been minting legions of new scholars and leaving a deep imprint on how scientists, economists, therapists, and everyday people think about human behavior. One of positive psychology's most influential figures is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, whom I mentioned earlier. Csikszentmihalyi's first book about flow and Seligman's first book on his theories (which argued that helplessness was learned, rather than innate, behavior) appeared in the same year as Deci's book on intrinsic motivation. Clearly, something big was in the air in 1975. It's just taken us a generation to reckon with it. The broad assortment of new thinkers includes Carol Dweck of Stanford University and Harvard's Amabile. It includes a few economists most prominently, Roland BŽnabou of Princeton University and Bruno Frey of the University of Zurich who are applying some of these concepts to the dismal science. And it includes some scholars who don't study motivation per se in particular, Harvard University's Howard Gardner and Tufts University's Robert Sternberg who have changed our view of intelligence and creativity and offered a brighter view of human potential. This collection of scholars not in concert, not intentionally, and perhaps not even knowing they've been doing so has been creating the foundation for a new, more effective, operating system. At long last, the times may be catching up to their work. THE POWER OF THE ALPHABET W ords matter, of course, but so do letters. Case in point: Meyer Friedman. You've probably never heard of him, but you almost certainly know his legacy. Friedman, who died in 2001 at the ripe old age of ninety, was a cardiologist who for decades ran a bustling office in San Francisco. In the late 1950s, he and fellow physician Ray Rosenman began noticing similarities in their patients who were prone to heart disease. It wasn't only what these patients ate or what genes they inherited that affected their susceptibility to coronary trouble. It was also how they led their lives. These patients, Friedman noted, demonstrated: a particular complex of personality traits, including excessive competition drive, aggressiveness, impatience, and a harrying sense of time urgency. Individuals displaying this pattern seem to be engaged in a chronic, ceaseless, and often fruitless struggle with themselves, with others, with circumstances, with time, sometimes with life itself. These people were significantly more likely to develop heart disease than other patients even those who shared similar physical attributes, exercise regimens, diets, and family histories. Looking for a convenient and memorable way to explain this insight to their medical colleagues and the wider world, Friedman and Rosenman found inspiration in the alphabet. They dubbed this behavioral pattern Type A. Type A behavior stood in contrast to natch Type B behavior. Unlike their horn-honking, foot-tapping counterparts, who suffered from hurry sickness, people displaying Type B behavior were rarely harried by life or made hostile by its demands. In their research, Friedman and Rosenman found that Type B people were just as intelligent, and frequently just as ambitious, as Type A's. But they wore their ambition differently. Writing about the Type B person (and using the male-centered language common in the day), the cardiologists explained, He may also have a considerable amount of Ôdrive,' but its character is such that it seems to steady him, give confidence and security to him, rather than to goad, irritate, and infuriate, as with the Type A man. One key to reducing deaths from heart disease and improving public health, therefore, was to help Type A's learn to become a little more like Type B's. Nearly fifty years later, this nomenclature remains. The two letters help us understand a complex web of behaviors and guide us toward a better and more effective way to live. Around the same time that Friedman and Rosenman were making their discovery, another American was pushing frontiers of his own. Douglas McGregor was a management professor at MIT who brought to the job an interesting combination of experiences. He'd earned a Ph.D. from Harvard in psychology (rather than in economics or engineering). And in contrast to most of his colleagues, he'd actually run an institution. From 1948 to 1954, he was president of Antioch College. Drawing on his understanding of the human psyche, as well as his experience as a leader, McGregor began rethinking the conventions of modern management. He thought that the problem with corporate leadership wasn't so much its execution as its premises. Beginning with a speech in 1957, and later in a groundbreaking book called The Human Side of Enterprise in 1960, McGregor argued that those running companies were operating from faulty assumptions about human behavior. Most leaders believed that the people in their organizations fundamentally disliked work and would avoid it if it they could. These faceless minions feared taking responsibility, craved security, and badly needed direction. As a result, most people must be coerced, controlled, directed, and threatened with punishment to get them to put forth adequate effort toward the achievement of organizational objectives. But McGregor said there was an alternative view of employees one that offered a more accurate assessment of the human condition and a more effective starting point for running companies. This perspective held that taking an interest in work is as natural as play or rest, that creativity and ingenuity were widely distributed in the population, and that under the proper conditions, people will accept, and even seek, responsibility. To explain these contrasting outlooks, McGregor mined the back end of the alphabet. He called the first view Theory X and the second Theory Y. If your starting point was Theory X, he said, your managerial techniques would inevitably produce limited results, or even go awry entirely. If you believed in the mediocrity of the masses, as he put it, then mediocrity became the ceiling on what you could achieve. But if your starting point was Theory Y, the possibilities were vast not simply for the individual's potential, but for the company's bottom line as well. The way to make business organizations work better, therefore, was to shift management thinking away from Theory X and toward Theory Y. Once again, the nomenclature stuck and McGregor's approach soon became a staple of management education. A picture may be worth a thousand words but sometimes neither is as potent as just two letters. So with a hoist from Meyer Friedman onto the shoulders of Douglas McGregor, I'd like to introduce my own alphabetic way to think about human motivation. TYPE I AND TYPE X T he Motivation 2.0 operating system depended on, and fostered, what I call Type X behavior. Type X behavior is fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones. It concerns itself less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which that activity leads. The Motivation 3.0 operating system the upgrade that's needed to meet the new realities of how we organize, think about, and do what we do depends on what I call Type I behavior. Type I behavior is fueled more by intrinsic desires than extrinsic ones. It concerns itself less with the external rewards to which an activity leads and more with the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself. At the center of Type X behavior is the second drive. At the center of Type I behavior is the third drive. If we want to strengthen our organizations, get beyond our decade of underachievement, and address the inchoate sense that something's gone wrong in our businesses, our lives, and our world, we need to move from Type X to Type I. (I use these two letters largely to signify extrinsic and intrinsic, but also to pay homage to Douglas McGregor.) To be sure, reducing human behavior to two categories sacrifices a certain amount of nuance. And nobody exhibits purely Type X or Type I behavior every waking minute of every living day without exception. But we do have certain, often very clear, dispositions. You probably know what I mean. Think about yourself. Does what energizes you what gets you up in the morning and propels you through the day come from the inside or from the outside? What about your spouse, your partner, or your children? How about the men and women around you at work? If you're like most people I've talked to, you instantly have a sense into which category someone belongs. I don't mean to say that Type X people always neglect the inherent enjoyment of what they do or that Type I people resist outside goodies of any kind. But for Type X's, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I's, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus. A few more distinctions to keep in mind before we go further: Type I behavior is made, not born. These behavioral patterns aren't fixed traits. They are proclivities that emerge from circumstance, experience, and context. Type I behavior, because it arises in part from universal human needs, does not depend on age, gender, or nationality. The science demonstrates that once people learn the fundamental practices and attitudes and can exercise them in supportive settings their motivation, and their ultimate performance, soars. Any Type X can become a Type I. Type I's almost always outperform Type X's in the long run. Intrinsically motivated people usually achieve more than their reward-seeking counterparts. Alas, that's not always true in the short term. An intense focus on extrinsic rewards can indeed deliver fast results. The trouble is, this approach is difficult to sustain. And it doesn't assist in mastery which is the source of achievement over the long haul. The most successful people, the evidence shows, often aren't directly pursuing conventional notions of success. They're working hard and persisting through difficulties because of their internal desire to control their lives, learn about their world, and accomplish something that endures. Type I behavior does not disdain money or recognition. Both Type X's and Type I's care about money. If an employee's compensation doesn't hit the baseline that I described in Chapter 2 if her organization doesn't pay her an adequate amount, or if her pay isn't equitable compared to others doing similar work that person's motivation will crater, regardless of whether she leans toward X or toward I. However, once compensation meets that level, money plays a different role for Type I's than for Type X's. Type I's don't turn down raises or refuse to cash paychecks. But one reason fair and adequate pay is so essential is that it takes the issue of money off the table so they can focus on the work itself. By contrast, for many Type X's, money is the table. It's why they do what they do. Recognition is similar. Type I's like being recognized for their accomplishments because recognition is a form of feedback. But for them, unlike for Type X's, recognition is not a goal in itself. Type I behavior is a renewable resource. Think of Type X behavior as coal and Type I behavior as the sun. For most of recent history, coal has been the cheapest, easiest, most efficient resource. But coal has two downsides. First, it produces nasty things like air pollution and greenhouse gases. Second, it's finite; getting more of it becomes increasingly difficult and expensive each year. Type X behavior is similar. An emphasis on rewards and punishments spews its own externalities (as enumerated in Chapter 2). And if-then motivators always grow more expensive. But Type I behavior, which is built around intrinsic motivation, draws on resources that are easily replenished and inflict little damage. It is the motivational equivalent of clean energy: inexpensive, safe to use, and endlessly renewable. Type I behavior promotes greater physical and mental well-being. According to a raft of studies from SDT researchers, people oriented toward autonomy and intrinsic motivation have higher self-esteem, better interpersonal relationships, and greater general well-being than those who are extrinsically motivated. By contrast, people whose core aspirations are Type X validations such as money, fame, or beauty tend to have poorer psychological health. There's even a connection between Type X and Type A. Deci found that those oriented toward control and extrinsic rewards showed greater public self-consciousness, acted more defensively, and were more likely to exhibit the Type A behavior pattern. Ultimately, Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose. Some might dismiss notions like these as gooey and idealistic, but the science says otherwise. The science confirms that this sort of behavior is essential to being human and that now, in a rapidly changing economy, it is also critical for professional, personal, and organizational success of any kind. So we have a choice. We can cling to a view of human motivation that is grounded more in old habits than in modern science. Or we can listen to the research, drag our business and personal practices into the twenty-first century, and craft a new operating system to help ourselves, our companies, and our world work a little better. It won't be easy. It won't happen overnight. So let's get started.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 4 Autonomy I 've seen the future and it works. It works in around-the-clock bursts in Sydney, Australia. It works on guerrilla-style side projects in Mountain View, California. And it works whenever it damn well pleases in Charlottesville, Virginia. The reason why it works is because of how it works. On the edges of the economy slowly, but inexorably old-fashioned ideas of management are giving way to a newfangled emphasis on self-direction. That's why, a little past noon on a rainy Friday in Charlottesville, only a third of CEO Jeff Gunther's employees have shown up for work. But Gunther entrepreneur, manager, capitalist is neither worried nor annoyed. In fact, he's as calm and focused as a monk. Maybe that's because he didn't roll into the office himself until about an hour ago. Or maybe that's because he knows his crew isn't shirking. They're working just on their own terms. At the beginning of the year, Gunther launched an experiment in autonomy at Meddius, one of a trio of companies he runs. He turned the company, which creates computer software and hardware to help hospitals integrate their information systems, into a ROWE a r esults-only work environment. ROWEs are the brainchild of Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson, two former human resources executives at the American retailer Best Buy. ROWE's principles marry the commonsense pragmatism of Ben Franklin to the cage-rattling radicalism of Saul Alinsky. In a ROWE workplace, people don't have schedules. They show up when they want. They don't have to be in the office at a certain time or any time, for that matter. They just have to get their work done. How they do it, when they do it, and where they do it is up to them. That appealed to Gunther, who's in his early thirties. Management isn't about walking around and seeing if people are in their offices, he told me. It's about creating conditions for people to do their best work. That's why he'd always tried to give employees a long leash. But as Meddius expanded, and as Gunther began exploring new office space, he started wondering whether talented, grown-up employees doing sophisticated work needed a leash of any length. So at the company's holiday dinner in December 2008, he made an announcement: For the first ninety days of the new year, the entire twenty-two-person operation would try an experiment. It would become a ROWE. In the beginning, people didn't take to it, Gunther says. The office filled up around nine A.M. and emptied out in the early evening, just as before. A few staffers had come out of extremely controlling environments and weren't accustomed to this kind of leeway. (At one employee's previous company, staff had to arrive each day by eight A.M. If someone was late, even by a few minutes, the employee had to write an explanation for everyone else to read.) But after a few weeks, most people found their groove. Productivity rose. Stress declined. And although two employees struggled with the freedom and left, by the end of the test period Gunther decided to go with ROWE permanently. Some people (outside of the company) thought I was crazy, he says. They wondered, ÔHow can you know what your employees are doing if they're not here?' But in his view, the team was accomplishing more under this new arrangement. One reason: They were focused on the work itself rather than on whether someone would call them a slacker for leaving at three P.M. to watch a daughter's soccer game. And since the bulk of his staff consists of software developers, designers, and others doing high-level creative work, that was essential. For them, it's all about craftsmanship. And they need a lot of autonomy. People still had specific goals they had to reach for example, completing a project by a certain time or ringing up a particular number of sales. And if they needed help, Gunther was there to assist. But he decided against tying those goals to compensation. That creates a culture that says it's all about the money and not enough about the work. Money, he believes, is only a threshold motivator. People must be paid well and be able to take care of their families, he says. But once a company meets this baseline, dollars and cents don't much affect performance and motivation. Indeed, Gunther thinks that in a ROWE environment, employees are far less likely to jump to another job for a $10,000 or even $20,000 increase in salary. The freedom they have to do great work is more valuable, and harder to match, than a pay raise and employees' spouses, partners, and families are among ROWE's staunchest advocates. More companies will migrate to this as more business owners my age come up. My dad's generation views human beings as human resources. They're the two-by-fours you need to build your house, he says. For me, it's a partnership between me and the employees. They're not resources. They're partners. And partners, like all of us, need to direct their own lives. PLAYERS OR PAWNS? W e forget sometimes that management does not emanate from nature. It's not like a tree or a river. It's like a television or a bicycle. It's something that humans invented. As the strategy guru Gary Hamel has observed, management is a technology. And like Motivation 2.0, it's a technology that has grown creaky. While some companies have oiled the gears a bit, and plenty more have paid lip service to the same, at its core management hasn't changed much in a hundred years. Its central ethic remains control; its chief tools remain extrinsic motivators. That leaves it largely out of sync with the nonroutine, right-brain abilities on which many of the world's economies now depend. But could its most glaring weakness run deeper? Is management, as it's currently constituted, out of sync with human nature itself ? The idea of management (that is, management of people rather than management of, say, supply chains) is built on certain assumptions about the basic natures of those being managed. It presumes that to take action or move forward, we need a prod that absent a reward or punishment, we'd remain happily and inertly in place. It also presumes that once people do get moving, they need direction that without a firm and reliable guide, they'd wander. But is that really our fundamental nature? Or, to use yet another computer metaphor, is that our default setting? When we enter the world, are we wired to be passive and inert? Or are we wired to be active and engaged? I'm convinced it's the latter that our basic nature is to be curious and self-directed. And I say that not because I'm a dewy-eyed idealist, but because I've been around young children and because my wife and I have three kids of our own. Have you ever seen a six-month-old or a one-year-old who's not curious and self-directed? I haven't. That's how we are out of the box. If, at age fourteen or forty-three, we're passive and inert, that's not because it's our nature. It's because something flipped our default setting. That something could well be management not merely how bosses treat us at work, but also how the broader ethos has leeched into schools, families, and many other aspects of our lives. Perhaps management isn't responding to our supposedly natural state of passive inertia. Perhaps management is one of the forces that's switching our default setting and producing that state. Now, that's not as insidious as it sounds. Submerging part of our nature in the name of economic survival can be a sensible move. My ancestors did it; so did yours. And there are times, even now, when we have no other choice. But today economic accomplishment, not to mention personal fulfillment, more often swings on a different hinge. It depends not on keeping our nature submerged but on allowing it to surface. It requires resisting the temptation to control people and instead doing everything we can to reawaken their deep-seated sense of autonomy. This innate capacity for self-direction is at the heart of Motivation 3.0 and Type I behavior. The fundamentally autonomous quality of human nature is central to self-determination theory (SDT). As I explained in the previous chapter, Deci and Ryan cite autonomy as one of three basic human needs. And of the three, it's the most important the sun around which SDT's planets orbit. In the 1980s, as they progressed in their work, Deci and Ryan moved away from categorizing behavior as either extrinsically motivated or intrinsically motivated to categorizing it as either controlled or autonomous. Autonomous motivation involves behaving with a full sense of volition and choice, they write, whereas controlled motivation involves behaving with the experience of pressure and demand toward specific outcomes that comes from forces perceived to be external to the self. The ultimate freedom for creative groups is the freedom to experiment with new ideas. Some skeptics insist that innovation is expensive. In the long run, innovation is cheap. Mediocrity is expensive and autonomy can be the antidote. TOM KELLEYGeneral Manager, IDEO Autonomy, as they see it, is different from independence. It's not the rugged, go-it-alone, rely-on-nobody individualism of the American cowboy. It means acting with choice which means we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent with others. And while the idea of independence has national and political reverberations, autonomy appears to be a human concept rather than a western one. Researchers have found a link between autonomy and overall well-being not only in North America and Western Europe, but also in Russia, Turkey, and South Korea. Even in high-poverty non-Western locales like Bangladesh, social scientists have found that autonomy is something that people seek and that improves their lives. A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude. According to a cluster of recent behavioral science studies, autonomous motivation promotes greater conceptual understanding, better grades, enhanced persistence at school and in sporting activities, higher productivity, less burnout, and greater levels of psychological well-being. Those effects carry over to the workplace. In 2004, Deci and Ryan, along with Paul Baard of Fordham University, carried out a study of workers at an American investment bank. The three researchers found greater job satisfaction among employees whose bosses offered autonomy support. These bosses saw issues from the employee's point of view, gave meaningful feedback and information, provided ample choice over what to do and how to do it, and encouraged employees to take on new projects. The resulting enhancement in job satisfaction, in turn, led to higher performance on the job. What's more, the benefits that autonomy confers on individuals extend to their organizations. For example, researchers at Cornell University studied 320 small businesses, half of which granted workers autonomy, the other half relying on top-down direction. The businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of the control-oriented firms and had one-third the turnover. Yet too many businesses remain woefully behind the science. Most twenty-first-century notions of management presume that, in the end, people are pawns rather than players. British economist Francis Green, to cite just one example, points to the lack of individual discretion at work as the main explanation for declining productivity and job satisfaction in the UK. Management still revolves largely around supervision, if-then rewards, and other forms of control. That's true even of the kinder, gentler Motivation 2.1 approach that whispers sweetly about things like empowerment and flexibility. Indeed, just consider the very notion of empowerment. It presumes that the organization has the power and benevolently ladles some of it into the waiting bowls of grateful employees. But that's not autonomy. That's just a slightly more civilized form of control. Or take management's embrace of flex time. Ressler and Thompson call it a con game, and they're right. Flexibility simply widens the fences and occasionally opens the gates. It, too, is little more than control in sheep's clothing. The words themselves reflect presumptions that run against both the texture of the times and the nature of the human condition. In short, management isn't the solution; it's the problem. Perhaps it's time to toss the very word management onto the linguistic ash heap alongside icebox and horseless carriage. This era doesn't call for better management. It calls for a renaissance of self-direction. THE FOUR ESSENTIALS I n 2002, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, two wet-behind-the-ears Australians just out of university, borrowed $10,000 on their credit cards to start a software company. They anointed their venture with a bold name Atlassian, after the Greek titan Atlas, who bore the world on his shoulders. And they set about creating a company to compete against some of the big names in enterprise software. At the time, their venture seemed loony. Today, it seems inspired. Through its combination of great computer code and smart business practices, Atlassian now rakes in about $35 million per year and employs nearly two hundred people in offices in Sydney, Amsterdam, and San Francisco. But like any good entrepreneur, Cannon-Brookes walks through life beneath a cloud of perpetual dissatisfaction. He'd seen successful companies stagnate and wished to avoid that fate for his. So to spark even greater creativity among his team, and to make sure Atlassian's programmers were having fun at work, he decided to encourage them to spend a day working on any problem they wanted, even if it wasn't part of their regular job. This offbeat off-day gave birth to several ideas for new products and plenty of repairs and patches on existing ones. So Cannon-Brookes decided to make the practice a permanent part of the Atlassian culture. Now, once a quarter, the company sets aside an entire day when its engineers can work on any software problem they want only this time, to get them out of the day to day, it must be something that's not part of their regular job. At two P.M. on a Thursday, the day begins. Engineers, including Cannon-Brookes himself, crash out new code or an elegant hack any way they want, with anyone they want. Many work through the night. Then, at four P.M. on Friday, they show the results to the rest of the company in a wild-and-woolly all-hands meeting stocked with ample quantities of cold beer and chocolate cake. Atlassian calls these twenty-four-hour bursts of freedom and creativity FedEx Days because people have to deliver something overnight. And deliver Atlassians have. Over the years, this odd little exercise has produced an array of software fixes that might otherwise never have emerged. Says one engineer, Some of the coolest stuff we have in our product today has come from FedEx Days. This isn't a pay-for-performance plan, grounded in the mechanistic assumptions of Motivation 2.0. It's an autonomy plan, nicely tuned to the alternate strains of Motivation 3.0. We've always taken the position that money is only something you can lose on, Cannon-Brookes told me. If you don't pay enough, you can lose people. But beyond that, money is not a motivator. What matters are these other features. And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with. As Atlassian's experience shows, Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four T's: their task , their time , their technique , and their team . Task Cannon-Brookes was still dissatisfied. FedEx Days were working fine, but they had an inherent weakness. You built something in twenty-four hours, but you didn't get any more time to work on it, he says. So he and cofounder Farquhar decided to double-down their bet on employee autonomy. In the spring of 2008, they announced that for the next six months, Atlassian developers could spend 20 percent of their time rather than just one intense day working on any project they wanted. As Cannon-Brookes explained in a blog post to employees: A startup engineer must be all things he (or she) is a full time software developer and a part time product manager/ customer support guru/internal systems maven. As a company grows, an engineer spends less time building the things he personally wants in the product. Our hope is that 20% time gives engineers back dedicated stack time of their own direction to spend on product innovation, features, plugins, fixes or additions that they think are the most important. This practice has a sturdy tradition and a well-known modern expression. Its pioneer was the American company 3M. In the 1930s and 1940s, 3M's president and chairman was William McKnight, a fellow who was as unassuming in his manner as he was visionary in his thinking. McKnight believed in a simple, and at the time, subversive, credo: Hire good people, and leave them alone. Well before it was fashionable for managers to flap on about empowerment, he made a more vigorous case for autonomy. Those men and women to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if they are good people, are going to want to do their jobs in their own way, he wrote in 1948. McKnight even encouraged employees to engage in what he called experimental doodling. As an entrepreneur, I'm blessed with 100% autonomy over task, time, technique and team. Here's the thing: If I maintain that autonomy, I fail. I fail to ship. I fail to excel. I fail to focus. I inevitably end up either with no product or a product the market rejects. The art of the art is picking your limits. That's the autonomy I most cherish. The freedom to pick my boundaries. SETH GODIN, Author of Tribes, Purple Cow, and the world's most popular marketing blog With these unorthodox ideas percolating in his mind, this unlikely corporate heretic established a new policy: 3M's technical staff could spend up to 15 percent of their time on projects of their choosing. The initiative felt so counter to the mores of Motivation 2.0, so seemingly illicit, that inside the company, it was known as the bootlegging policy. And yet it worked. These walled gardens of autonomy soon became fertile fields for a harvest of innovations including Post-it notes. Scientist Art Fry came up with his idea for the ubiquitous stickie not in one of his regular assignments, but during his 15 percent time. Today, Post-its are a monumental business: 3M offers more than six hundred Post-it products in more than one hundred countries. (And their cultural impact might be even greater. Consider: But for McKnight's early push for autonomy, we'd be living in a world without any small yellow squares stuck to our computer monitors. A chilling thought indeed.) According to 3M's former head of research and development, most of the inventions that the company relies on even today emerged from those periods of bootlegging and experimental doodling. McKnight's innovation remains in place at 3M. But only a surprisingly small number of other companies have moved in this direction, despite its proven results. The best-known company to embrace it is Google, which has long encouraged engineers to spend one day a week working on a side project. Some Googlers use their 20 percent time to fix an existing product, but most use it to develop something entirely new. Of course, Google doesn't sign away the intellectual property rights to what's created during that 20 percent which is wise. In a typical year, more than half of Google's new offerings are birthed during this period of pure autonomy. For example, scientist Krishna Bharat, frustrated by how difficult it was to find news stories online, created Google News in his 20 percent time. The site now receives millions of visitors every day. Former Google engineer Paul Bucheit created Gmail, now one of the world's most popular e-mail programs, as his 20 percent project. Many other Google products share similar creation stories among them Orkut (Google's social networking software), Google Talk (its instant message application), Google Sky (which allows astronomically inclined users to browse pictures of the universe), and Google Translate (its translation software for mobile devices). As Google engineer Alec Proudfoot, whose own 20 percent project aimed at boosting the efficiency of hybrid cars, put it in a television interview: Just about all the good ideas here at Google have bubbled up from 20 percent time. Back at Atlassian, the experiment in 20 percent time seemed to work. In what turned out to be a yearlong trial, developers launched forty-eight new projects. So in 2009, Cannon-Brookes decided to make this dose of task autonomy a permanent feature of Atlassian work life. The decision didn't sit well with everyone. By Cannon-Brookes's back-of-the-blog calculations, seventy engineers, spending 20 percent of their time over just a six-month period, amounted to an investment of $1 million. The company's chief financial officer was aghast. Some project managers despite Atlassian's forward-thinking ways, the company still uses the m-word weren't happy, because it meant ceding some of their control over employees. When a few wanted to track employees' time to make sure they didn't abuse the privilege, Cannon-Brookes said no. That was too controlling. I wanted to back our engineers and take it on faith that they'll do good things. Besides, he says, People are way more efficient about 20 percent time than regular work time. They say, ÔI'm not going to [expletive]ing do anything like read newsfeeds or do Facebook.' These days, when a finance guy, pearls of sweat rolling from his green eyeshades, objects to the price tag, Cannon-Brookes has a ready response: I show him a long list of things we've delivered. I show him that we have zero turnover in engineering. And I show him that we have highly motivated engineers who are always trying to perfect and improve our product. Autonomy over task is one of the essential aspects of the Motivation 3.0 approach to work. And it isn't reserved only for technology companies. At Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., for instance, many nurses have the freedom to conduct their own research projects, which in turn have changed a number of the hospital's programs and policies. Autonomy measures can work in a range of fields and offer a promising source for innovations and even institutional reforms. Initiatives like FedEx Days and sanctioned side projects aren't always easy to execute in the day-to-day maw of serving customers, shipping products, and solving problems. But they're becoming urgent in an economy that demands nonroutine, creative, conceptual abilities as any artist or designer would agree. Autonomy over task has long been critical to their ability to create. And good leaders (as opposed to competent managers) understand this in their bones. Case in point: George Nelson, who was the design director at Her-man Miller, the iconic American furniture maker, for a few decades. He once laid down five simple tenets that he believed led to great design. One of these principles could serve as a rallying cry for Type I's ethic of autonomy over task: You decide what you will make. Time Ever wonder why lawyers, as a group, are so miserable? Some social scientists have and they've offered three explanations. One involves pessimism. Being pessimistic is almost always a recipe for low levels of what psychologists call subjective well-being. It's also a detriment in most professions. But as Martin Seligman has written, There is one glaring exception: pessimists do better at law. In other words, an attitude that makes someone less happy as a human being actually makes her more effective as a lawyer. A second reason: Most other enterprises are positive-sum. If I sell you something you want and enjoy, we're both better off. Law, by contrast, is often (though not always) a zero-sum game: Because somebody wins, somebody else must lose. But the third reason might offer the best explanation of all and help us understand why so few attorneys exemplify Type I behavior. Lawyers often face intense demands but have relatively little decision latitude. Behavioral scientists use this term to describe the choices, and perceived choices, a person has. In a sense, it's another way of describing autonomy and lawyers are glum and cranky because they don't have much of it. The deprivation starts early. A 2007 study of two American law schools found that over the three-year period in school, students' overall well-being plummeted in large part because their need for autonomy was thwarted. But students who had greater autonomy over their course selection, their assignments, and their relations with professors showed far less steep declines and actually posted better grades and bar exam scores. Nothing is more important to my success than controlling my schedule. I'm most creative from five to nine A.M. If I had a boss or co-workers, they would ruin my best hours one way or another. SCOTT ADAMS Dilbert creator Alas, at the heart of private legal practice is perhaps the most autonomy-crushing mechanism imaginable: the billable hour. Most lawyers and nearly all lawyers in large, prestigious firms must keep scrupulous track, often in six-minute increments, of their time. If they fail to bill enough hours, their jobs are in jeopardy. As a result, their focus inevitably veers from the output of their work (solving a client's problem) to its input (piling up as many hours as possible). If the rewards come from time, then time is what firms will get. These sorts of high-stakes, measurable goals can drain intrinsic motivation, sap individual initiative, and even encourage unethical behavior. If one is expected to bill more than two thousand hours per year, former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist once said, there are bound to be temptations to exaggerate the hours actually put in. The billable hour is a relic of Motivation 2.0. It makes some sense for routine tasks whether fitting doors onto the body of a Ford Taurus or adding up deductions on a simple tax form because there's a tight connection between how much time goes in and how much work comes out. And if your starting assumption is that workers' default setting is to shirk, monitoring their time can keep them on their toes. But the billable hour has little place in Motivation 3.0. For nonroutine tasks, including law, the link between how much time somebody spends and what that somebody produces is irregular and unpredictable. Imagine requiring inventor Dean Kamen or actress Helen Mirren to bill for their time. If we begin from an alternative, and more accurate, presumption that people want to do good work then we ought to let them focus on the work itself rather than the time it takes them to do it. Already, a few law firms are moving in this new, more Type I direction charging a flat rate rather than a time-based fee with the presiding partner of one of New York's leading law firms recently declaring, This is the time to get rid of the billable hour. If the billable hour has an antithesis, it's the results-only work environment of the kind that Jeff Gunther has introduced at his companies. The first large company to go ROWE was Best Buy not in its stores, but in its corporate offices. Like 3M's 15 percent time, Best Buy's ROWE experiment began as something of a rogue project launched by Ressler and Thompson, whom I mentioned earlier and who have since become ROWE gurus, taking their message of autonomy around the world. Best Buy's headquarters in Richfield, Minnesota, are airy, modern, and replete with a concierge, cafŽs, and dry cleaner. But the company had a reputation for punishing hours and intrusive bosses and it was paying the price in lost talent. Best Buy's then CEO Brad Anderson quietly agreed to Ressler and Thompson's weird proposal, because it encouraged people to contribute rather than just show up and grind out their days. Today, Best Buy's headquarters has fewer people working a regular schedule than it has those working a ROWE un-schedule. And even though retail electronics is a brutally competitive industry, Best Buy has held its own both in the marketplace and in its quest for talent. Reporting on the company's ROWE results in the Harvard Business Review , Tamara Erickson writes: Salaried people put in as much time as it takes to do their work. Hourly employees in the program work a set number of hours to comply with federal labor regulations, but they get to choose when. Those employees report better relationships with family and friends, more company loyalty, and more focus and energy. Productivity has increased by 35%, and voluntary turnover is 320 basis points lower than in teams that have not made the change. Employees say they don't know whether they work fewer hours they've stopped counting. Without sovereignty over our time, it's nearly impossible to have autonomy over our lives. A few Type I organizations have begun to recognize this truth about the human condition and to realign their practices. More, no doubt, will follow. In the past, work was defined primarily by putting in time, and secondarily on getting results. We need to flip that model, Ressler told me. No matter what kind of business you're in, it's time to throw away the tardy slips, time clocks, and outdated industrial-age thinking. Technique When you call a customer service line to complain about your cable television bill or to check the whereabouts of that blender you ordered, the phone usually rings in a colorless cavern known as a call center. The person who answers the call, a customer service representative, has a tough job. He typically sits for hours among a warren of cramped cubicles headset strapped on, a diet soda by his side. The pay is paltry. And the people the rep encounters on the phone one after another after another generally aren't ringing up to offer kudos or to ask about the rep's weekend plans. They've got a gripe, a frustration, or a problem that needs solving. Right. Now. If that weren't trying enough, call center reps have little decision latitude and their jobs are often the very definition of routine. When a call comes in, they listen to the caller and then, in most cases, tap a few buttons on their computer to retrieve a script. Then they follow that script, sometimes word for word, in the hope of getting the caller off the line as quickly as possible. It can be deadening work, made drearier still because managers in many call centers, in an effort to boost productivity, listen in on reps' conversations and monitor how long each call lasts. Little wonder, then, that call centers in the United States and the UK have annual turnover rates that average about 35 percent, double the rate for other jobs. In some call centers the annual turnover rate exceeds 100 percent, meaning that, on average, none of the people working there today will be there a year from now. Tony Hsieh, founder of the online shoe retailer (now part of ), thought there was a better way to recruit, prepare, and challenge such employees. So new hires at Zappos go through a week of training. Then, at the end of those seven days, Hsieh makes them an offer. If they feel Zappos isn't for them and want to leave, he'll pay them $2,000 no hard feelings. Hsieh is hacking the Motivation 2.0 operating system like a brilliant and benevolent teenage computer whiz. He's using an if-then reward not to motivate people to perform better, but to weed out those who aren't fit for a Motivation 3.0-style workplace. The people who remain receive decent pay, and just as important, they have autonomy over technique. Zappos doesn't monitor its customer service employees' call times or require them to use scripts. The reps handle calls the way they want. Their job is to serve the customer well; how they do it is up to them. The results of this emphasis on autonomy over technique? Turnover at Zappos is minimal. And although it's still young, Zappos consistently ranks as one of the best companies for customer service in the United States ahead of better-known names like Cadillac, BMW, and Apple and roughly equal to ritzy brands like Jaguar and the Ritz-Carlton. Not bad for a shoe company based in the Nevada desert. What Zappos is doing is part of a small but growing move to restore some measure of individual freedom in jobs usually known for the lack of it. For instance, while many enterprises are offshoring work to low-cost providers overseas, some companies are reversing the trend by beginning what's known as homeshoring. Instead of requiring customer service reps to report to a single large call center, they're routing the calls to the employees' homes. This cuts commuting time for staff, removes them from physical monitoring, and provides far greater autonomy over how they do their jobs. The American airline JetBlue was one of the first to try this approach. From its launch in 2000, JetBlue has relied on telephone customer service employees who work at home. And from its launch, JetBlue has earned customer service rankings far ahead of its competitors. Productivity and job satisfaction are generally higher in homeshoring than in conventional arrangements in part because employees are more comfortable and less monitored at home. But it's also because this autonomy-centered approach draws from a deeper pool of talent. Many homeshore employees are parents, students, retirees, and people with disabilities those who want to work, but need to do it their own way. According to one report, between 70 and 80 percent of home-based customer service agents have college degrees double the percentage among people working in traditional call centers. Ventures like Alpine Access, PHH Arval, and LiveOps, which run customer service departments for a range of companies, report that after adopting this method, their recruiting costs fall to almost zero. Prospective employees come to them. And now these home-based customer service reps are working for a number of U.S. companies including 1-800-Flowers, J. Crew, Office Depot, even the Internal Revenue Service handling customer inquiries the way they choose. As in any effective Motivation 3.0 workplace, it's their call. Team Whatever your place in the birth order, consider what it's like to be the third child in a family. You don't get a say in choosing the people around you. They're there when you arrive. Worse, one or two of them might not be so glad to see you. And getting rid of even just one of them is usually impossible. Autonomy over what we do is most important. The biggest difference between working for other studios and running my own has been the fact that I can choose what job we take on and what product, service, or institution we promote. This I find the single most important question: When I'm close to the content, research becomes easy, meetings become interesting (people who produce interesting products or services are mostly interesting themselves), and I don't have to be involved in false advertising. STEFAN SAGMEISTERDesigner Taking a new job and holding most jobs are similar. Enterprising souls might be able to scratch out some autonomy over task, time, and technique but autonomy over team is a taller order. That's one reason people are drawn to entrepreneurship the chance to build a team of their own. But even in more traditional settings, although far from typical yet, a few organizations are discovering the virtues of offering people some amount of freedom over those with whom they work. For example, at the organic grocery chain Whole Foods, the people who are nominally in charge of each department don't do the hiring. That task falls to a department's employees. After a job candidate has worked a thirty-day trial period on a team, the prospective teammates vote on whether to hire that person full-time. At W. L. Gore & Associates, the makers of the GORE-TEX fabric and another example of Motivation 3.0 in action, anybody who wants to rise in the ranks and lead a team must assemble people willing to work with her. The ability to put together a pick-up basketball team of company talent is another attraction of 20 percent time. These initiatives usually slice across the organization chart, connecting people who share an interest, if not a department. As Google engineer Bharat Mediratta told The New York Times , If your 20 percent idea is a new product, it's usually pretty easy to just find a few like-minded people and start coding away. And when pushing for a more systemic change in the organization, Mediratta says autonomy over team is even more important. Those efforts require what he calls a grouplet a small, self-organized team that has almost no budget and even less authority, but that tries to change something within the company. For instance, Mediratta formed a testing grouplet to encourage engineers throughout the company to implement a more efficient way to test computer code. This informal band of coders, a team built autonomously without direction from the top, slowly turned the organization on its axis. Still, the desire for autonomy can often collide with other obligations. One surprise as Atlassian ran the numbers on its task autonomy experiment was that most employees came in substantially under the 20 percent figure. The main reason? They didn't want to let down their current teammates by abandoning ongoing projects. Although autonomy over team is the least developed of the four T's, the ever-escalating power of social networks and the rise of mobile apps now make this brand of autonomy easier to achieve and in ways that reach beyond a single organization. The open-source projects I mentioned in Chapter 1, in which ad hoc teams self-assemble to build a new browser or create better server software, are a potent example. And once again, the science affirms the value of something traditional businesses have been slow to embrace. Ample research has shown that people working in self-organized teams are more satisfied than those working in inherited teams. Likewise, studies by Deci and others have shown that people high in intrinsic motivation are better coworkers. And that makes the possibilities on this front enormous. If you want to work with more Type I's, the best strategy is to become one yourself. Autonomy, it turns out, can be contagious. THE ART OF AUTONOMY Think for a moment about the great artists of the last hundred years and how they worked people like Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Jackson Pollock. Unlike for the rest of us, Motivation 2.0 was never their operating system. Nobody told them: You must paint this sort of picture. You must begin painting precisely at eight-thirty A.M . You must paint with the people we select to work with you. And you must paint this way. The very idea is ludicrous. But you know what? It's ludicrous for you, too. Whether you're fixing sinks, ringing up groceries, selling cars, or writing a lesson plan, you and I need autonomy just as deeply as a great painter. However, encouraging autonomy doesn't mean discouraging accountability. Whatever operating system is in place, people must be accountable for their work. But there are different ways to achieve this end, each built on different assumptions about who we are deep down. Motivation 2.0 assumed that if people had freedom, they would shirk and that autonomy was a way to bypass accountability. Motivation 3.0 begins with a different assumption. It presumes that people want to be accountable and that making sure they have control over their task, their time, their technique, and their team is a pathway to that destination. Of course, because most workplaces still reverberate with the assumptions of the old operating system, transitioning to autonomy won't often can't happen in one fell swoop. If we pluck people out of controlling environments, when they've known nothing else, and plop them in a ROWE or an environment of undiluted autonomy, they'll struggle. Organizations must provide, as Richard Ryan puts it, scaffolding to help every employee find his footing to make the transition. What's more, different individuals will prize different aspects of autonomy. Some might crave autonomy over a task; others might prefer autonomy over the team. As Zappos CEO Hsieh told me by e-mail, Studies have shown that perceived control is an important component of one's happiness. However, what people feel like they want control over really varies, so I don't think there's one aspect of autonomy that's universally the most important. Different individuals have different desires, so the best strategy for an employer would be to figure out what's important to each individual employee. Still, however those individual desires express themselves on the surface, they grow from common roots. We're born to be players, not pawns. We're meant to be autonomous individuals, not individual automatons. We're designed to be Type I. But outside forces including the very idea that we need to be managed have conspired to change our default setting and turn us into Type X. If we update the environments we're in not only at work, but also at school and at home and if leaders recognize both the truth of the human condition and the science that supports it, we can return ourselves and our colleagues to our natural state. The course of human history has always moved in the direction of greater freedom. And there's a reason for that because it's in our nature to push for it, Ryan told me. If we were just plastic like [some] people think, this wouldn't be happening. But somebody stands in front of a tank in China. Women, who've been denied autonomy, keep advocating for rights. This is the course of history. This is why ultimately human nature, if it ever realizes itself, will do so by becoming more autonomous.",

        "text": "CHAPTER 5 Mastery You need not see what someone is doing to know if it is his vocation, you have only to watch his eyes: a cook mixing a sauce, a surgeon making a primary incision, a clerk completing a bill of lading, wear the same rapt expression, forgetting themselves in a function. How beautiful it is, that eye-on-the-object look. W. H. Auden O ne summer morning in 1944, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, age ten, stood on a train platform in Budapest, Hungary, with his mother, two brothers, and about seventy relatives who'd come to see them off. World War II was raging, and Hungary, an ambivalent member of the Axis, was being squeezed from every political and geographic corner. Nazi soldiers were occupying the country in retaliation for Hungary's secret peace negotiations with the United States and Great Britain. Meanwhile, Soviet troops were advancing on the capital city. It was time to leave. So the foursome boarded a train for Venice, Italy, where Csikszentmihalyi's father, a diplomat, was working. As the train rumbled southwest, bombs exploded in the distance. Bullets ripped through the train's windows, while a rifle-toting soldier on board fired back at the attackers. The ten-year-old crouched under his seat, terrified but also a little annoyed. It struck me at that point that grown-ups had really no idea how to live, Csikszentmihalyi told me some sixty-five years later. His train would turn out to be the last to cross the Danube River for many years. Shortly after its departure, air strikes destroyed Hungary's major bridges. The Csikszentmihalyis were well educated and well connected, but the war flattened their lives. Of the relatives on the train platform that morning, more than half would be dead five months later. One of Csikszentmihalyi's brothers spent six years doing hard labor in the Ural Mountains. Another was killed fighting the Soviets. The whole experience got me thinking, Csikszentmihalyi said, recalling his ten-year-old self. There has got to be a better way to live than this. FROM COMPLIANCE TO ENGAGEMENT T he opposite of autonomy is control. And since they sit at different poles of the behavioral compass, they point us toward different destinations. Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement. And this distinction leads to the second element of Type I behavior: mastery the desire to get better and better at something that matters. As I explained in Part One, Motivation 2.0's goal was to encourage people to do particular things in particular ways that is, to get them to comply. And for that objective, few motivators are more effective than a nice bunch of carrots and the threat of an occasional stick. This was rarely a promising route to self-actualization, of course. But as an economic strategy, it had a certain logic. For routine tasks, the sort of work that defined most of the twentieth century, gaining compliance usually worked just fine. But that was then. For the definitional tasks of the twenty-first century, such a strategy falls short, often woefully short. Solving complex problems requires an inquiring mind and the willingness to experiment one's way to a fresh solution. Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one's way in today's economy. Unfortunately, despite sweet-smelling words like empowerment that waft through corporate corridors, the modern workplace's most notable feature may be its lack of engagement and its disregard for mastery. Gallup's extensive research on the subject shows that in the United States, more than 50 percent of employees are not engaged at work and nearly 20 percent are actively disengaged. The cost of all this disengagement: about $300 billion a year in lost productivity a sum larger than the GDP of Portugal, Singapore, or Israel. Yet in comparative terms, the United States looks like a veritable haven of Type I behavior at work. According to the consulting firm McKinsey & Co., in some countries as little as 2 to 3 percent of the workforce is highly engaged in their work. Equally important, engagement as a route to mastery is a powerful force in our personal lives. While complying can be an effective strategy for physical survival, it's a lousy one for personal fulfillment. Living a satisfying life requires more than simply meeting the demands of those in control. Yet in our offices and our classrooms we have way too much compliance and way too little engagement. The former might get you through the day, but only the latter will get you through the night. And that brings us back to Csikszentmihalyi's story. In his early teens, after witnessing the atrocities of Nazi Germany and the Soviet takeover of his country, Csikszentmihalyi was understandably weary of compliance and looking for engagement. But he wouldn't find it at school. He dropped out of high school at thirteen. For nearly a decade, he worked in various Western European countries at a series of jobs, some odder than others, to support himself. And hoping to answer his youthful question about a better way to live, he read everything he could get his hands on in religion and philosophy. What he learned didn't satisfy him. It wasn't until he inadvertently stumbled into a lecture by none other than Carl Jung that he heard about the field of psychology and decided that it might hold the secrets he sought. So in 1956, at the age of twenty-two, Csikszentmihalyi set off for the United States to study psychology. He arrived in Chicago, a high school dropout with $1.25 in his pocket whose only familiarity with the English language came from reading Pogo comic strips. Hungarian contacts in Chicago helped him find a job and a place to live. His knowledge of Latin, German, and Pogo helped him pass the Illinois high school equivalency test in a language he neither spoke nor read. He enrolled in the University of Illinois-Chicago, took classes during the day, worked as a hotel auditor at night, and eventually wound up at the University of Chicago psychology department, where just nine years after setting foot in America he earned a Ph.D. But Csikszentmihalyi resisted rafting down the main currents of his field. As he told me one spring morning not long ago, he wanted to explore the positive, innovative, creative approach to life instead of the remedial, pathological view that Sigmund Freud had or the mechanistic work of B. F. Skinner and others who reduced behavior to simple stimulus and response. He began by writing about creativity. Creativity took him into the study of play. And his exploration of play unlocked an insight about the human experience that would make him famous. In the midst of play, many people enjoyed what Csikszentmihalyi called autotelic experiences from the Greek auto (self ) and telos (goal or purpose). In an autotelic experience, the goal is self-fulfilling; the activity is its own reward. Painters he observed during his Ph.D. research, Csikszentmihalyi said, were so enthralled in what they were doing that they seemed to be in a trance. For them, time passed quickly and self-consciousness dissolved. He sought out other people who gravitated to these sorts of pursuits rock climbers, soccer players, swimmers, spelunkers and interviewed them to discover what made an activity autotelic. It was frustrating. When people try to recall how it felt to climb a mountain or play a great musical piece, Csikszentmihalyi later wrote, their stories are usually quite stereotyped and uninsightful. He needed a way to probe people's experiences in the moment. And in the mid-1970s, a bold new technology one that any twelve-year-old now would find laughingly retrograde came to the rescue: the electronic pager. Csikszentmihalyi, who by then was teaching at the University of Chicago and running his own psychology lab, clipped on a pager and asked his graduate students to beep him randomly several times each day. Whenever the pager sounded, he recorded what he was doing and how he was feeling. It was so much fun, he recalled in his office at the Claremont Graduate University in southern California, where he now teaches. You got such a detailed picture of how people lived. On the basis of this test run, he developed a methodology called the Experience Sampling Method. Csikszentmihalyi would page people eight times a day at random intervals and ask them to write in a booklet their answers to several short questions about what they were doing, who they were with, and how they'd describe their state of mind. Put the findings together for seven days and you had a flip book, a mini-movie, of someone's week. Assemble the individual findings and you had an entire library of human experiences. Throughout my athletics career, the overall goal was always to be a better athlete than I was at that moment whether next week, next month or next year. The improvement was the goal. The medal was simply the ultimate reward for achieving that goal. SEBASTIAN COEMiddle-distance runnerand two-time Olympicgold medal winner From these results, Csikszentmihalyi began to peel back the layers of those autotelic experiences. Perhaps equally significant, he replaced that wonky Greek-derived adjective with a word he found people using to describe these optimal moments: flow. The highest, most satisfying experiences in people's lives were when they were in flow. And this previously unacknowledged mental state, which seemed so inscrutable and transcendent, was actually fairly easy to unpack. In flow, goals are clear. You have to reach the top of the mountain, hit the ball across the net, or mold the clay just right. Feedback is immediate. The mountaintop gets closer or farther, the ball sails in or out of bounds, the pot you're throwing comes out smooth or uneven. Most important, in flow, the relationship between what a person had to do and what he could do was perfect. The challenge wasn't too easy. Nor was it too difficult. It was a notch or two beyond his current abilities, which stretched the body and mind in a way that made the effort itself the most delicious reward. That balance produced a degree of focus and satisfaction that easily surpassed other, more quotidian, experiences. In flow, people lived so deeply in the moment, and felt so utterly in control, that their sense of time, place, and even self melted away. They were autonomous, of course. But more than that, they were engaged. They were, as the poet W. H. Auden wrote, forgetting themselves in a function. Maybe this state of mind was what that ten-year-old boy was seeking as that train rolled through Europe. Maybe reaching flow, not for a single moment but as an ethic for living maintaining that beautiful eye-on-the-object look to achieve mastery as a cook, a surgeon, or a clerk was the answer. Maybe this was the way to live. GOLDILOCKS ON A CARGO SHIP Several years ago he can't recall exactly when Csikszentmihalyi was invited to Davos, Switzerland, by Klaus Schwab, who runs an annual conclave of the global power elite in that city. Joining him on the trip were three other University of Chicago faculty members Gary Becker, George Stigler, and Milton Friedman all of them economists, all of them winners of the Nobel Prize. The five men gathered for dinner one night and at the end of the meal, Schwab asked the academics what they considered the most important issue in modern economics. The desire to do something because you find it deeply satisfying and personally challenging inspires the highest levels of creativity, whether it's in the arts, sciences, or business. TERESA AMABILEProfessor, Harvard University To my incredulous surprise, Csikszentmihalyi recounted, Becker, Stigler, and Friedman all ended up saying a variation of ÔThere's something missing,' that for all its explanatory power, economics still failed to offer a rich enough account of behavior, even in business settings. Csikszentmihalyi smiled and complimented his colleagues on their perspicacity. The concept of flow, which he introduced in the mid-1970s, was not an immediate game-changer. It gained some traction in 1990 when Csikszentmihalyi wrote his first book on the topic for a wide audience and gained a small band of followers in the business world. However, putting this notion into place in the real operations of real organizations has been slower going. After all, Motivation 2.0 has little room for a concept like flow. The Type X operating system doesn't oppose people taking on optimal challenges on the job, but it suggests that such moments are happy accidents rather than necessary conditions for people to do great work. But ever so slowly the ground might be shifting. As the data on worker disengagement earlier in the chapter reveal, the costs in both human satisfaction and organizational health are high when a workplace is a no-flow zone. That's why a few enterprises are trying to do things differently. As Fast Company magazine has noted, a number of companies, including Microsoft, Patagonia, and Toyota, have realized that creating flow-friendly environments that help people move toward mastery can increase productivity and satisfaction at work. For example, Stefan Falk, a vice president at Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications concern, used the principles of flow to smooth a merger of the company's business units. He persuaded managers to configure work assignments so that employees had clear objectives and a way to get quick feedback. And instead of meeting with their charges for once-a-year performance reviews, managers sat down with employees one-on-one six times a year, often for as long as ninety minutes, to discuss their level of engagement and path toward mastery. The flow-centered strategy worked well enough that Ericsson began using it in offices around the world. After that, Falk moved to Green Cargo, an enormous logistics and shipping company in Sweden. There, he developed a method of training managers in how flow worked. Then he required them to meet with staff once a month to get a sense of whether people were overwhelmed or underwhelmed with their work and to adjust assignments to help them find flow. After two years of managerial revamping, state-owned Green Cargo became profitable for the first time in 125 years and executives cite its newfound flowcentricity as a key reason. In addition, a study of 11,000 industrial scientists and engineers working at companies in the United States found that the desire for intellectual challenge that is, the urge to master something new and engaging was the best predictor of productivity. Scientists motivated by this intrinsic desire filed significantly more patents than those whose main motivation was money, even controlling for the amount of effort each group expended. (That is, the extrinsically motivated group worked as long and as hard as their more Type I colleagues. They just accomplished less perhaps because they spent less of their work time in flow.) And then there's Jenova Chen, a young game designer who, in 2006, wrote his MFA thesis on Csikszentmihalyi's theory. Chen believed that video games held the promise to deliver quintessential flow experiences, but that too many games required an almost obsessive level of commitment. Why not, he thought, design a game to bring the flow sensation to more casual gamers? Using his thesis project as his laboratory, Chen created a game in which players use a computer mouse to guide an on-screen amoeba-like organism through a surreal ocean landscape as it gobblies other creatures and slowly evolves into a higher form. While most games require players to proceed through a fixed and predetermined series of skill levels, Chen's allows them to advance and explore any way they desire. And unlike games in which failure ends the session, in Chen's game failure merely pushes the player to a level better matched to her ability. Chen calls his game flOw. And it's been a huge hit. People have played the free online version of the game more than three million times. (You can find it at ). The paid version, designed for the PlayStation game console, has generated more than 350,000 downloads and collected a shelf full of awards. Chen used the game to launch his own firm, thatgamecompany, built around both flow and flOw, that quickly won a three-game development deal from Sony, something almost unheard of for an unknown start-up run by a couple of twenty-six-year-old California game designers. Green Cargo, thatgamecompany, and the companies employing the patent-cranking scientists typically use two tactics that their less savvy competitors do not. First, they provide employees with what I call Goldilocks tasks challenges that are not too hot and not too cold, neither overly difficult nor overly simple. One source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch between what people must do and what people can do. When what they must do exceeds their capabilities, the result is anxiety. When what they must do falls short of their capabilities, the result is boredom. (Indeed, Csikszentmihalyi titled his first book on autotelic experiences Beyond Boredom and Anxiety .) But when the match is just right, the results can be glorious. This is the essence of flow. Goldilocks tasks offer us the powerful experience of inhabiting the zone, of living on the knife's edge between order and disorder, of as painter Fritz Scholder once described it walking the tightrope between accident and discipline. The second tactic that smart organizations use to increase their flow-friendliness and their employees' opportunities for mastery is to trigger the positive side of the Sawyer Effect. Recall from Chapter 2 that extrinsic rewards can turn play into work. But it's also possible to run the current in the other direction and turn work into play. Some tasks at work don't automatically provide surges of flow, yet still need to get done. So the shrewdest enterprises afford employees the freedom to sculpt their jobs in ways that bring a little bit of flow to otherwise mundane duties. Amy Wrzesniewski and Jane Dutton, two business school professors, have studied this phenomenon among hospital cleaners, nurses, and hairdressers. They found, for instance, that some members of the cleaning staff at hospitals, instead of doing the minimum the job required, took on new tasks from chatting with patients to helping make nurses' jobs go more smoothly. Adding these more absorbing challenges increased these cleaners' satisfaction and boosted their own views of their skills. By reframing aspects of their duties, they helped make work more playful and more fully their own. Even in low-autonomy jobs, Wrzesniewski and Dutton write, employees can create new domains for mastery. THE THREE LAWS OF MASTERY Flow is essential to mastery. But flow doesn't guarantee mastery because the two concepts operate on different horizons of time. One happens in a moment; the other unfolds over months, years, sometimes decades. You and I each might reach flow tomorrow morning but neither one of us will achieve mastery overnight. So how can we enlist flow in the quest for something that goes deeper and endures longer? What can we do to move toward mastery, one of the key elements of Type I behavior, in our organizations and our lives? A few behavioral scientists have offered some initial answers to those questions, and their findings suggest that mastery abides by three, somewhat peculiar, laws. Mastery Is a Mindset As with so many things in life, the pursuit of mastery is all in our head. At least that's what Carol Dweck has discovered. Dweck, a psychology professor at Stanford University, has been studying motivation and achievement in children and young adults for nearly forty years, amassing a body of rigorous empirical research that has made her a superstar in contemporary behavioral science. Dweck's signature insight is that what people believe shapes what people achieve. Our beliefs about ourselves and the nature of our abilities what she calls our self-theories determine how we interpret our experiences and can set the boundaries on what we accomplish. Although her research looks mostly at notions of intelligence, her findings apply with equal force to most human capabilities. And they yield the first law of mastery: Mastery is a mindset . According to Dweck, people can hold two different views of their own intelligence. Those who have an entity theory believe that intelligence is just that an entity. It exists within us, in a finite supply that we cannot increase. Those who subscribe to an incremental theory take a different view. They believe that while intelligence may vary slightly from person to person, it is ultimately something that, with effort, we can increase. To analogize to physical qualities, incremental theorists consider intelligence as something like strength. (Want to get stronger and more muscular? Start pumping iron.) Entity theorists view it as something more like height. (Want to get taller? You're out of luck.) If you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity, then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of how much you have. If you believe intelligence is something you can increase, then the same encounters become opportunities for growth. In one view, intelligence is something you demonstrate; in the other, it's something you develop. Figure out for yourself what you want to be really good at, know that you'll never really satisfy yourself that you've made it, and accept that that's okay. ROBERT B. REICHFormer U.S. Secretary of Labor The two self-theories lead down two very different paths one that heads toward mastery and one that doesn't. For instance, consider goals. Dweck says they come in two varieties performance goals and learning goals. Getting an A in French class is a performance goal. Being able to speak French is a learning goal. Both goals are entirely normal and pretty much universal, Dweck says, and both can fuel achievement. But only one leads to mastery. In several studies, Dweck found that giving children a performance goal (say, getting a high mark on a test) was effective for relatively straightforward problems but often inhibited children's ability to apply the concepts to new situations. For example, in one study, Dweck and a colleague asked junior high students to learn a set of scientific principles, giving half of the students a performance goal and half a learning goal. After both groups demonstrated they had grasped the material, researchers asked the students to apply their knowledge to a new set of problems, related but not identical to what they'd just studied. Students with learning goals scored significantly higher on these novel challenges. They also worked longer and tried more solutions. As Dweck writes, With a learning goal, students don't have to feel that they're already good at something in order to hang in and keep trying. After all, their goal is to learn, not to prove they're smart. Indeed, the two self-theories take very different views of effort. To incremental theorists, exertion is positive. Since incremental theorists believe that ability is malleable, they see working harder as a way to get better. By contrast, says Dweck, the entity theory . . . is a system that requires a diet of easy successes. In this schema, if you have to work hard, it means you're not very good. People therefore choose easy targets that, when hit, affirm their existing abilities but do little to expand them. In a sense, entity theorists want to look like masters without expending the effort to attain mastery. Finally, the two types of thinking trigger contrasting responses to adversity one that Dweck calls helpless, the other, mastery-oriented. In a study of American fifth- and sixth-graders, Dweck gave students eight conceptual problems they could solve, followed by four they could not (because the questions were too advanced for children that age). Students who subscribed to the idea that brain-power is fixed gave up quickly on the tough problems and blamed their (lack of ) intelligence for their difficulties. Students with a more expansive mindset kept working in spite of the difficulty and deployed far more inventive strategies to find a solution. What did these students blame for their inability to conquer the toughest problems? The answer, which surprised us, was that they didn't blame anything, Dweck says. The young people recognized that setbacks were inevitable on the road to mastery and that they could even be guideposts for the journey. Dweck's insights map nicely to the behavioral distinctions underlying Motivation 2.0 and Motivation 3.0. Type X behavior often holds an entity theory of intelligence, prefers performance goals to learning goals, and disdains effort as a sign of weakness. Type I behavior has an incremental theory of intelligence, prizes learning goals over performance goals, and welcomes effort as a way to improve at something that matters. Begin with one mindset, and mastery is impossible. Begin with the other, and it can be inevitable. Mastery Is a Pain Each summer, about twelve hundred young American men and women arrive at the United States Military Academy at West Point to begin four years of study and to take their place in the fabled long gray line. But before any of them sees a classroom, they go through seven weeks of Cadet Basic Training otherwise known as Beast Barracks. By the time the summer ends, one in twenty of these talented, dedicated young adults has dropped out. A group of scholars two from West Point, another from the University of Pennsylvania, and a fourth from the University of Michigan wanted to understand why some students continued on the road toward military mastery and others got off at the first exit. Try to pick a profession in which you enjoy even the most mundane, tedious parts. Then you will always be happy. WILL SHORTZPuzzle guru Was it physical strength and athleticism? Intellect? Leadership ability? Well-roundedness? None of the above. The best predictor of success, the researchers found, was the prospective cadets' ratings on a noncognitive, non-physical trait known as grit defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals. The experience of these army officers-in-training confirms the second law of mastery: Mastery is a pain . As wonderful as flow is, the path to mastery becoming ever better at something you care about is not lined with daisies and spanned by a rainbow. If it were, more of us would make the trip. Mastery hurts. Sometimes many times it's not much fun. That is one lesson of the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson, whose groundbreaking research on expert performance has provided a new theory of what fosters mastery. As he puts it, Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent are actually the results of intense practice for a minimum of 10 years. Mastery of sports, music, business requires effort (difficult, painful, excruciating, all-consuming effort) over a long time (not a week or a month, but a decade). Sociologist Daniel Chambliss has referred to this as the mundanity of excellence. Like Ericsson, Chambliss found in a three-year study of Olympic swimmers that those who did the best typically spent the most time and effort on the mundane activities that readied them for races. It's the same reason that, in another study, the West Point grit researchers found that grittiness rather than IQ or standardized test scores is the most accurate predictor of college grades. As they explained, Whereas the importance of working harder is easily apprehended, the importance of working longer without switching objectives may be less perceptible . . . in every field, grit may be as essential as talent to high accomplishment. Flow enters the picture here in two ways. If people are conscious of what puts them in flow, they'll have a clearer idea of what they should devote the time and dedication to master. And those moments of flow in the course of pursuing excellence can help people through the rough parts. But in the end, mastery often involves working and working and showing little improvement, perhaps with a few moments of flow pulling you along, then making a little progress, and then working and working on that new, slightly higher plateau again. It's grueling, to be sure. But that's not the problem; that's the solution. As Carol Dweck says, Effort is one of the things that gives meaning to life. Effort means you care about something, that something is important to you and you are willing to work for it. It would be an impoverished existence if you were not willing to value things and commit yourself to working toward them. Another doctor, one who lacks a Ph.D. but has a plaque in the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, put it similarly. Being a professional, Julius Erving once said, is doing the things you love to do, on the days you don't feel like doing them. Mastery Is an Asymptote To understand the final law of mastery, you need to know a little algebra and a little art history. From algebra, you might remember the concept of an asymptote. If not, maybe you'll recognize it below. An asymptote (in this case, a horizontal asymptote) is a straight line that a curve approaches but never quite reaches. From art history, you might remember Paul CŽzanne, the nineteenth-century French painter. You needn't remember much just that he was significant enough to have art critics and scholars write about him. CŽzanne's most enduring paintings came late in his life. And one reason for this, according to University of Chicago economist David Galenson, who's studied the careers of artists, is that he was endlessly trying to realize his best work. For CŽzanne, one critic wrote, the ultimate synthesis of a design was never revealed in a flash; rather he approached it with infinite precautions, stalking it, as it were, now from one point of view, now from another. . . . For him the synthesis was an asymptote toward which he was for ever approaching without ever quite reaching it. This is the nature of mastery: Mastery is an asymptote. You can approach it. You can home in on it. You can get really, really, really close to it. But like CŽzanne, you can never touch it. Mastery is impossible to realize fully. Tiger Woods, perhaps the greatest golfer of all time, has said flatly that he can that he must become better. He said it when he was an amateur. He'll say it after his best outing or at the end of his finest season. He's pursuing mastery. That's well-known. What's less well-known is that he understands that he'll never get it. It will always hover beyond his grasp. The mastery asymptote is a source of frustration. Why reach for something you can never fully attain? But it's also a source of allure. Why not reach for it? The joy is in the pursuit more than the realization. In the end, mastery attracts precisely because mastery eludes. THE OXYGEN OF THE SOUL The subjects were displaying the warning signs of generalized anxiety disorder, a mental illness that afflicts roughly 3 percent of the adult population. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM-IV ), the presence of any three of the following six symptoms indicates what could be a serious problem: ¥ Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge ¥ Being easily fatigued ¥ Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank ¥ Irritability ¥ Muscle tension ¥ Sleep disturbance These men and women seemed textbook cases. One person, who had previously glided through life with equanimity, now felt tense, more hostile, angry, and irritated. Another reported being more irritable, restless, and suffering from shorter concentration. Yet another scribbled this self-description: Slept badly, listless, more nervous, more guarded. Some people feared they were having a nervous breakdown. One person's mind was so muddied that he inadvertently walked into a wall and broke his glasses. Time for a trip to the psychiatrist or a prescription for antianxiety medicine? No. It was time for people to let flow back into their lives. In the early 1970s, Csikszentmihalyi conducted an experiment in which he asked people to record all the things they did in their lives that were noninstrumental that is, small activities they undertook not out of obligation or to achieve a particular objective, but because they enjoyed them. Then he issued the following set of instructions: Beginning [morning of target date], when you wake up and until 9:00 PM, we would like you to act in a normal way, doing all the things you have to do, but not doing anything that is play or noninstrumental. In other words, he and his research team directed participants to scrub their lives of flow. People who liked aspects of their work had to avoid situations that might trigger enjoyment. People who relished demanding physical exercise had to remain sedentary. One woman enjoyed washing dishes because it gave her something constructive to do, along with time to fantasize free of guilt, but could wash dishes only when absolutely necessary. The results were almost immediate. Even at the end of the first day, participants noticed an increased sluggishness about their behavior. They began complaining of headaches. Most reported difficulty concentrating, with thoughts [that] wander round in circles without getting anywhere. Some felt sleepy, while others were too agitated to sleep. As Csikszentmihalyi wrote, After just two days of deprivation . . . the general deterioration in mood was so advanced that prolonging the experiment would have been unadvisable. Two days. Forty-eight hours without flow plunged people into a state eerily similar to a serious psychiatric disorder. The experiment suggests that flow, the deep sense of engagement that Motivation 3.0 calls for, isn't a nicety. It's a necessity. We need it to survive. It is the oxygen of the soul. And one of Csikszentmihalyi's more surprising findings is that people are much more likely to reach that flow state at work than in leisure. Work can often have the structure of other autotelic experiences: clear goals, immediate feedback, challenges well matched to our abilities. And when it does, we don't just enjoy it more, we do it better. That's why it's so odd that organizations tolerate work environments that deprive large numbers of people of these experiences. By offering a few more Goldilocks tasks, by looking for ways to unleash the positive side of the Sawyer Effect, organizations can help their own cause and enrich people's lives. Csikszentmihalyi grasped this essential reality more than thirty years ago, when he wrote, There is no reason to believe any longer that only irrelevant Ôplay' can be enjoyed, while the serious business of life must be borne as a burdensome cross. Once we realize that the boundaries between work and play are artificial, we can take matters in hand and begin the difficult task of making life more livable. But if we're looking for guidance on how to do this right on how to make mastery an ethic for living our best role models are probably not sitting around a boardroom table or working in the office down the hall. Over lunch, Csikszentmihalyi and I talked about children. A little kid's life bursts with autotelic experiences. Children careen from one flow moment to another, animated by a sense of joy, equipped with a mindset of possibility, and working with the dedication of a West Point cadet. They use their brains and their bodies to probe and draw feedback from the environment in an endless pursuit of mastery. Then at some point in their lives they don't. What happens? You start to get ashamed that what you're doing is childish, Csikszentmihalyi explained. What a mistake. Perhaps you and I and all the other adults in charge of things are the ones who are immature. It goes back to Csikszentmihalyi's experience on the train, wondering how grown-ups could have gotten things so wrong. Our circumstances may be less dire, but the observation is no less acute. Left to their own devices, Csikszentmihalyi says, children seek out flow with the inevitability of a natural law. So should we all.",

        "heading": "Chapter 8",
        "text": "CHAPTER 6 Purpose W e know from statisticians that demographics is destiny. And we know from the Rolling Stones that you can't always get what you want. What we don't know is what happens when these two indomitable principles sit down, pour themselves a drink, and get to know each other better. But we're about to find out. In 2006, the first members of the baby-boom generation began turning sixty. On birthdays with big round numbers, people usually stop, reflect, and take stock of their lives. And I've found that when boomers, in the United States and elsewhere, reach this milestone, they typically move through a three-stage reaction. In the first stage, they ask: How the heck did I get to be sixty? When their odometer flips to 6-0, people often are surprised and slightly alarmed. Sixty, they think, is old. They tally their regrets and confront the reality that Mick Jagger and crew were right, that they didn't always get what they wanted. But then the second stage kicks in. In the not-so-distant past, turning sixty meant that you were somewhat, ahem, long in the tooth. But at the beginning of the twenty-first century, anyone who's healthy enough to have made it six decades is probably healthy enough to hang on a fair bit longer. According to United Nations data, a sixty-year-old American man can expect to live for another twenty-plus years; a sixty-year-old American woman will be around for another quarter of a century. In Japan, a sixty-year-old man can expect to live past his eighty-second birthday, a sixty-year-old woman to nearly eighty-eight. The pattern is the same in many other prosperous countries. In France, Israel, Italy, Switzerland, Canada, and elsewhere, if you've reached the age of sixty, you're more than likely to live into your eighties. And this realization brings with it a certain relief. Whew, the boomer in Toronto or Osaka sighs. I've got a couple more decades. But the relief quickly dissipates because almost as soon as the sigh fades, people enter the third stage. Upon comprehending that they could have another twenty-five years, sixty-year-old boomers look back twenty-five years to when they were thirty-five and a sudden thought clonks them on the side of the head. Wow. That sure happened fast, they say. Will the next twenty-five years race by like that? If so, when am I going to do something that matters? When am I going to live my best life? When am I going to make a difference in the world? Those questions, which swirl through conversations taking place at boomer kitchen tables around the world, may sound touchy-feely. But they're now occurring at a rate that is unprecedented in human civilization. Consider: Boomers are the largest demographic cohort in most western countries, as well as in places like Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States alone has about 78 million boomers which means that, on average, each year more than four million Americans hit this soul-searching, life-pondering birthday. That's more than 11,000 people each day, more than 450 every hour. In other words, in America alone, one hundred boomers turn sixty every thirteen minutes . Every thirteen minutes another hundred people members of the wealthiest and best-educated generation the world has ever known begin reckoning with their mortality and asking deep questions about meaning, significance, and what they truly want. One hundred people. Every thirteen minutes. Every hour. Of every day. Until 2024. When the cold front of demographics meets the warm front of unrealized dreams, the result will be a thunderstorm of purpose the likes of which the world has never seen. THE PURPOSE MOTIVE The first two legs of the Type I tripod, autonomy and mastery, are essential. But for proper balance we need a third leg purpose, which provides a context for its two mates. Autonomous people working toward mastery perform at very high levels. But those who do so in the service of some greater objective can achieve even more. The most deeply motivated people not to mention those who are most productive and satisfied hitch their desires to a cause larger than themselves. Motivation 2.0, however, doesn't recognize purpose as a motivator. The Type X operating system doesn't banish the concept, but it relegates it to the status of ornament a nice accessory if you want it, so long as it doesn't get in the way of the important stuff. Yet by taking this view, Motivation 2.0 neglects a crucial part of who we are. From the moment that human beings first stared into the sky, contemplated their place in the universe, and tried to create something that bettered the world and outlasted their lives, we have been purpose seekers. Purpose provides activation energy for living, psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi told me in an interview. I think that evolution has had a hand in selecting people who had a sense of doing something beyond themselves. I believe wholeheartedly that a new form of capitalism is emerging. More stakeholders (customers, employees, shareholders, and the larger community) want their businesses to . . . have a purpose bigger than their product. MATS LEDERHAUSENInvestor and formerMcDonald's executive Motivation 3.0 seeks to reclaim this aspect of the human condition. Baby boomers around the world because of the stage of their lives and the size of their numbers are nudging purpose closer to the cultural center. In response, business has begun to rethink how purpose figures in what it does. As an emotional catalyst, wealth maximization lacks the power to fully mobilize human energies, says strategy guru (and boomer) Gary Hamel. Those staggering levels of worker disengagement I described in the previous chapter have a companion trend that companies are only starting to recognize: an equally sharp rise in volunteerism, especially in the United States. These diverging lines compensated engagement going down, uncompensated effort going up suggest that volunteer work is nourishing people in ways that paid work simply is not. We're learning that the profit motive, potent though it is, can be an insufficient impetus for both individuals and organizations. An equally powerful source of energy, one we've often neglected or dismissed as unrealistic, is what we might call the purpose motive. This is the final big distinction between the two operating systems. Motivation 2.0 centered on profit maximization. Motivation 3.0 doesn't reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life goals, words, and policies. In a curious way, age is simpler than youth, for it has so many fewer options. STANLEY KUNITZFormer U.S. poet laureate Goals Boomers aren't singing alone in their chorus of purpose. Joining them, and using the same hymnbook, are their sons and daughters known as Generation Y, the millennials, or the echo boomers. These young adults, who have recently begun entering the workforce themselves, are shifting the center of gravity in organizations by their very presence. As the writer Sylvia Hewlett has found in her research, the two bookend generations are redefining success [and] are willing to accept a radically Ôremixed' set of rewards. Neither generation rates money as the most important form of compensation. Instead they choose a range of nonmonetary factors from a great team to the ability to give back to society through work. And if they can't find that satisfying package of rewards in an existing organization, they'll create a venture of their own. Take the case of American Gen Y-er Blake Mycoskie and TOMS Shoes, the company he launched in 2006. TOMS doesn't fit snugly into the traditional business boxes. It offers hip, canvas, flat-soled shoes. But every time TOMS sells a pair of shoes to you, me, or your next-door neighbor, it gives away another pair of new shoes to a child in a developing country. Is TOMS a charity that finances its operation with shoe sales? Or is it a business that sacrifices its earnings in order to do good? It's neither and it's both. The answer is so confusing, in fact, that TOMS Shoes had to address the question directly on its website, just below information on how to return a pair that's too big. TOMS, the site explains, is a for-profit company with giving at its core. Got it? No? Okay, try this: The company's business model transforms our customers into benefactors. Better? Maybe. Weirder? Certainly. Ventures like TOMS blur, perhaps even shatter, the existing categories. Their goals, and the way companies reach them, are so incompatible to Motivation 2.0 that if TOMS had to rely on this twentieth-century operating system, the whole endeavor would seize up and crash in the entrepreneurial equivalent of a blue screen of death. Motivation 3.0, by contrast, is expressly built for purpose maximization. In fact, the rise of purpose maximizers is one reason we need the new operating system in the first place. As I explained in Chapter 1, operations like TOMS are on the vanguard of a broader rethinking of how people organize what they do. For benefit organizations, B corporations, and low-profit limited-liability corporations all recast the goals of the traditional business enterprise. And all are becoming more prevalent as a new breed of businessperson seeks purpose with the fervor that traditional economic theory says entrepreneurs seek profit. Even cooperatives an older business model with motives other than profit maximization are moving from the shaggy edge to the clean-cut center. According to writer Marjorie Kelly, in the last three decades, worldwide membership in co-ops has doubled to 800 million people. In the United States alone, more people belong to a co-op than own shares in the stock market. And the idea is spreading. In Colombia, Kelly notes, SaludCoop provides health-care services to a quarter of the population. In Spain, the Mondrag—n Corporaci—n Cooperativa is the nation's seventh largest industrial concern. These not only for profit enterprises are a far cry from the socially responsible businesses that have been all the rage for the last fifteen years but have rarely delivered on their promise. The aims of these Motivation 3.0 companies are not to chase profit while trying to stay ethical and law-abiding. Their goal is to pursue purpose and to use profit as the catalyst rather than the objective. Words In the spring of 2009, as the world economy was reeling from a once-in-a-generation crisis and the financial shenanigans that stoked it, a few Harvard Business School students glanced in the mirror and wondered if they were the problem. The people they'd aspired to be financiers and corporate dealmakers weren't, it turned out, heroes in an epic tale, but villains in a darker story. Many of these high-profile businesspeople were the ones who pushed the financial system to the brink. Meanwhile, these young men and women looked among their classmates and saw the seeds of similar behavior. In one survey of MBA students a few years earlier, a whopping 56 percent admitted to cheating regularly. So a handful of Harvard second-years, fearing that what was once a badge of honor had become three scarlet letters, did what business students are trained to do. They made a plan. Together they fashioned what they called The MBA Oath a Hippocratic oath for business grads in which they pledge their fealty to causes above and beyond the bottom line. It's not a legal document. It's a code of conduct. And the conduct it recommends, as well as the very words it uses, leans more toward purpose maximization than profit maximization. From the first sentence, the oath rings with the sounds of Motivation 3.0: As a manager, my purpose is to serve the greater good by bringing people and resources together to create value that no single individual can create alone, it begins. And on it goes for nearly five hundred words. I will safeguard the interests of my shareholders, co-workers, customers and the society in which we operate, the oath-takers pledge. I will strive to create sustainable economic, social, and environmental prosperity worldwide. These words purpose, greater good, sustainable don't come from the Type X dictionary. One rarely hears them in business school because, after all, that's not what business school is supposed to be about. Yet students at arguably the world's most powerful MBA factory thought otherwise. And in just a few weeks, roughly one-quarter of the graduating class had taken the oath and signed the pledge. In launching the effort, Max Anderson, one of the student founders, said: My hope is that at our 25th reunion our class will not be known for how much money we made or how much money we gave back to the school, but for how the world was a better place as a result of our leadership. Words matter. And if you listen carefully, you might begin to hear a slightly different slightly more purpose-oriented dialect. Gary Hamel, whom I mentioned above, says, The goals of management are usually described in words like Ôefficiency,' Ôadvantage,' Ôvalue,' Ôsuperiority,' Ôfocus,' and Ôdifferentiation.' Important as these objectives are, they lack the power to rouse human hearts. Business leaders, he says, must find ways to infuse mundane business activities with deeper, soul-stirring ideals, such as honor, truth, love, justice, and beauty. Humanize what people say and you may well humanize what they do. That's the thinking behind the simple and effective way Robert B. Reich, former U.S. labor secretary, gauges the health of an organization. He calls it the pronoun test. When he visits a workplace, he'll ask the people employed there some questions about the company. He listens to the substance of their response, of course. But most of all, he listens for the pronouns they use. Do the workers refer to the company as they? Or do they describe it in terms of we? They companies and we companies, he says, are very different places. And in Motivation 3.0, we wins. Policies Between the words businesses use and the goals they seek sit the policies they implement to turn the former into the latter. Here, too, one can detect the early tremors of a different approach. For example, many companies in the last decade spent considerable time and effort crafting corporate ethics guidelines. Yet instances of unethical behavior don't seem to have declined. Valuable though those guidelines can be, as a policy they can unintentionally move purposeful behavior out of the Type I schema and into Type X. As Harvard Business School professor Max Bazerman has explained: Say you take people who are motivated to behave nicely, then give them a fairly weak set of ethical standards to meet. Now, instead of asking them to do it because it's the right thing to do, you've essentially given them an alternate set of standards do this so you can check off all these boxes. The value of a life can be measured by one's ability to affect the destiny of one less advantaged. Since death is an absolute certainty for everyone, the important variable is the quality of life one leads between the times of birth and death. BILL STRICKLANDFounder of the ManchesterCraftsmen's Guild, and MacArthurgenius award winner Imagine an organization, for example, that believes in affirmative action one that wants to make the world a better place by creating a more diverse workforce. By reducing ethics to a checklist, suddenly affirmative action is just a bunch of requirements that the organization must meet to show that it isn't discriminating. Now the organization isn't focused on affirmatively pursuing diversity but rather on making sure that all the boxes are checked off to show that what it did is OK (and so it won't get sued). Before, its workers had an intrinsic motivation to do the right thing, but now they have an extrinsic motivation to make sure that the company doesn't get sued or fined. In other words, people might meet the minimal ethical standards to avoid punishment, but the guidelines have done nothing to inject purpose into the corporate bloodstream. The better approach could be to enlist the power of autonomy in the service of purpose maximization. Two intriguing examples demonstrate what I mean. First, many psychologists and economists have found that the correlation between money and happiness is weak that past a certain (and quite modest) level, a larger pile of cash doesn't bring people a higher level of satisfaction. But a few social scientists have begun adding a bit more nuance to this observation. According to Lara Aknin and Elizabeth Dunn, sociologists at the University of British Columbia, and Michael Norton, a psychologist at the Harvard Business School, how people spend their money may be at least as important as how much money they earn. In particular, spending money on other people (buying flowers for your spouse rather than an MP3 player for yourself ) or on a cause (donating to a religious institution rather than going for an expensive haircut) can actually increase our subjective well-being. In fact, Dunn and Norton propose turning their findings on what they call pro-social spending into corporate policy. According to The Boston Globe , they believe that companies can improve their employees' emotional well-being by shifting some of their budget for charitable giving so that individual employees are given sums to donate, leaving them happier even as the charities of their choice benefit. In other words, handing individual employees control over how the organization gives back to the community might do more to improve their overall satisfaction than one more if-then financial incentive. Another study offers a second possible purpose-centered policy prescription. Physicians in high-profile settings like the Mayo Clinic face pressures and demands that can often lead to burnout. But field research at the prestigious medical facility found that letting doctors spend one day a week on the aspect of their job that was most meaningful to them whether patient care, research, or community service could reduce the physical and emotional exhaustion that accompanies their work. Doctors who participated in this trial policy had half the burnout rate of those who did not. Think of it as 20 percent time with a purpose. THE GOOD LIFE Each year about thirteen hundred seniors graduate from the University of Rochester and begin their journey into what many of their parents and professors like to call the real world. Edward Deci, Richard Ryan, and their colleague Christopher Niemiec decided to ask a sample of these soon-to-be graduates about their life goals and then to follow up with them early in their careers to see how they were doing. While much social science research is done with student volunteers, scientists rarely track students after they've packed up their diplomas and exited the campus gates. And these researchers wanted to study the post-college time frame because it represents a critical development period that marks people's transitions to their adult identities and lives. Some of the U of R students had what Deci, Ryan, and Niemiec label extrinsic aspirations for instance, to become wealthy or to achieve fame what we might call profit goals. Others had intrinsic aspirations to help others improve their lives, to learn, and to grow or what we might think of as purpose goals. After these students had been out in the real word for between one and two years, the researchers tracked them down to see how they were faring. The people who'd had purpose goals and felt they were attaining them reported higher levels of satisfaction and subjective well-being than when they were in college, and quite low levels of anxiety and depression. That's probably no surprise. They'd set a personally meaningful goal and felt they were reaching it. In that situation, most of us would likely feel pretty good, too. But the results for people with profit goals were more complicated. Those who said they were attaining their goals accumulating wealth, winning acclaim reported levels of satisfaction, self-esteem, and positive affect no higher than when they were students. In other words, they'd reached their goals, but it didn't make them any happier. What's more, graduates with profit goals showed increases in anxiety, depression, and other negative indicators again, even though they were attaining their goals. One cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one belongs to something greater and more permanent than oneself. MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI These findings are rather striking, the researchers write, as they suggest that attainment of a particular set of goals [in this case, profit goals] has no impact on well-being and actually contributes to i ll-being. When I discussed these results with Deci and Ryan, they were especially emphatic about their significance because the findings suggest that even when we do get what we want, it's not always what we need. People who are very high in extrinsic goals for wealth are more likely to attain that wealth, but they're still unhappy, Ryan told me. Or as Deci put it, The typical notion is this: You value something. You attain it. Then you're better off as a function of it. But what we find is that there are certain things that if you value and if you attain them, you're worse off as a result of it, not better off. Failing to understand this conundrum that satisfaction depends not merely on having goals, but on having the right goals can lead sensible people down self-destructive paths. If people chase profit goals, reach those goals, and still don't feel any better about their lives, one response is to increase the size and scope of the goals to seek more money or greater outside validation. And that can drive them down a road of further unhappiness thinking it's the road to happiness, Ryan said. One of the reasons for anxiety and depression in the high attainers is that they're not having good relationships. They're busy making money and attending to themselves and that means that there's less room in their lives for love and attention and caring and empathy and the things that truly count, Ryan added. And if the broad contours of these findings are true for individuals, why shouldn't they also be true for organizations which, of course, are collections of individuals? I don't mean to say that profit doesn't matter. It does. The profit motive has been an important fuel for achievement. But it's not the only motive. And it's not the most important one. Indeed, if we were to look at history's greatest achievements from the printing press to constitutional democracy to cures for deadly diseases the spark that kept the creators working deep into the night was purpose at least as much as profit. A healthy society and healthy business organizations begins with purpose and considers profit a way to move toward that end or a happy by-product of its attainment. And here the boomers maybe, just maybe can take the lead. On the subjects of autonomy and mastery, adults should look to the eloquent example of children. But perhaps purpose is another matter. Being able to contemplate the big picture, to ponder one's own mortality, to understand the paradox that attaining certain goals isn't the answer seem to require having spent a few years on the planet. And since the planet very soon will contain more people over age sixty-five than under age five for the first time in its existence, the timing couldn't be better. It's in our nature to seek purpose. But that nature is now being revealed and expressed on a scale that is demographically unprecedented and, until recently, scarcely imaginable. The consequences could rejuvenate our businesses and remake our world. A CENTRAL IDEA of this book has been the mismatch between what science knows and what business does. The gap is wide. Its existence is alarming. And though closing it seems daunting, we have reasons to be optimistic. The scientists who study human motivation, several of whom we've encountered in this book, offer us a sharper and more accurate account of both human performance and the human condition. The truths they've revealed are simple, yet powerful. The science shows that those typical twentieth-century carrot-and-stick motivators things we consider somehow a natural part of human enterprise can sometimes work. But they're effective in only a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances. The science shows that if-then rewards the mainstays of the Motivation 2.0 operating system not only are ineffective in many situations, but also can crush the high-level, creative, conceptual abilities that are central to current and future economic and social progress. The science shows that the secret to high performance isn't our biological drive or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our third drive our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and to live a life of purpose. Bringing our businesses in sync with these truths won't be easy. Unlearning old ideas is difficult, undoing old habits even harder. And I'd be less sanguine about the prospects of closing the motivation gap anytime soon, if it weren't for this: The science confirms what we already know in our hearts. We know that human beings are not merely smaller, slower, better-smelling horses galloping after that day's carrot. We know if we've spent time with young children or remember ourselves at our best that we're not destined to be passive and compliant. We're designed to be active and engaged. And we know that the richest experiences in our lives aren't when we're clamoring for validation from others, but when we're listening to our own voice doing something that matters, doing it well, and doing it in the service of a cause larger than ourselves. So, in the end, repairing the mismatch and bringing our understanding of motivation into the twenty-first century is more than an essential move for business. It's an affirmation of our humanity.",

Although the world is awash in extrinsic motivators, there's a lot we can do to bring more autonomy, mastery, and purpose into our work and life. Here are nine exercises to get you on the right track. GIVE YOURSELF A FLOW TEST M ihaly Csikszentmihalyi did more than discover the concept of flow. He also introduced an ingenious new technique to measure it. Csikszentmihalyi and his University of Chicago team equipped participants in their research studies with electronic pagers. Then they paged people at random intervals (approximately eight times a day) for a week, asking them to describe their mental state at that moment. Compared with previous methods, these real-time reports proved far more honest and revealing. You can use Csikszentmihalyi's methodological innovation in your own quest for mastery by giving yourself a flow test. Set a reminder on your computer or mobile phone to go off at forty random times in a week. Each time your device beeps, write down what you're doing, how you're feeling, and whether you're in flow. Record your observations, look at the patterns, and consider the following questions: ¥ Which moments produced feelings of flow? Where were you? What were you working on? Who were you with? ¥ Are certain times of day more flow-friendly than others? How could you restructure your day based on your findings? ¥ How might you increase the number of optimal experiences and reduce the moments when you felt disengaged or distracted? ¥ If you're having doubts about your job or career, what does this exercise tell you about your true source of intrinsic motivation? FIRST, ASK A BIG QUESTION . . . I n 1962, Clare Boothe Luce, one of the first women to serve in the U.S. Congress, offered some advice to President John F. Kennedy. A great man, she told him, is one sentence. Abraham Lincoln's sentence was: He preserved the union and freed the slaves. Franklin Roosevelt's was: He lifted us out of a great depression and helped us win a world war. Luce feared that Kennedy's attention was so splintered among different priorities that his sentence risked becoming a muddled paragraph. You don't have to be a president of the United States or of your local gardening club to learn from this tale. One way to orient your life toward greater purpose is to think about your sentence. Maybe it's: He raised four kids who became happy and healthy adults. Or She invented a device that made people's lives easier. Or He cared for every person who walked into his office regardless of whether that person could pay. Or She taught two generations of children how to read. As you contemplate your purpose, begin with the big question: What's your sentence? . . . THEN KEEP ASKING A SMALL QUESTION T he big question is necessary, but not sufficient. That's where the small question comes in. Real achievement doesn't happen overnight. As anyone who's trained for a marathon, learned a new language, or run a successful division can attest, you spend a lot more time grinding through tough tasks than you do basking in applause. Here's something you can do to keep yourself motivated. At the end of each day, ask yourself whether you were better today than you were yesterday. Did you do more? Did you do it well? Or to get specific, did you learn your ten vocabulary words, make your eight sales calls, eat your five servings of fruits and vegetables, write your four pages? You don't have to be flawless each day. Instead, look for small measures of improvement such as how long you practiced your saxophone or whether you held off on checking e-mail until you finished that report you needed to write. Reminding yourself that you don't need to be a master by day 3 is the best way of ensuring you will be one by day 3,000. So before you go to sleep each night, ask yourself the small question: Was I better today than yesterday? TAKE A SAGMEISTER T he designer Stefan Sagmeister has found a brilliant way to ensure he's living a Type I life. Think about the standard pattern in developed countries, he says. People usually spend the first twenty-five or so years of their lives learning, the next forty or so years working, and the final twenty-five in retirement. That boilerplate timeline got Sagmeister wondering: Why not snip five years from retirement and sprinkle them into your working years? So every seven years, Sagmeister closes his graphic design shop, tells his clients he won't be back for a year, and goes off on a 365-day sabbatical. He uses the time to travel, to live places he's never been, and to experiment with new projects. It sounds risky, I know. But he says the ideas he generates during the year off often provide his income for the next seven years. Taking a Sagmeister, as I now call it, requires a fair bit of planning and saving, of course. But doesn't forgoing that big-screen TV seem a small price to pay for an unforgettable and un-get-backable year of personal exploration? The truth is, this idea is more realistic than many of us realize. Which is why I hope to take a Sagmeister in a couple of years and why you should consider it, too. GIVE YOURSELF A PERFORMANCE REVIEW P erformance reviews, those annual or biannual rituals of organizational life, are about as enjoyable as a toothache and as productive as a train wreck. Nobody likes them not the giver, not the receiver. They don't really help us achieve mastery since the feedback often comes six months after the work is complete. (Imagine Serena Williams or Twyla Tharp seeing their results or reading reviews only twice a year.) And yet managers keep on hauling employees into their offices for those awkward, painful encounters. Maybe there's a better way. Maybe, as Douglas McGregor and others have suggested, we should give ourselves our own performance reviews. Here's how. Figure out your goals mostly learning goals, but also a few performance goals and then every month, call yourself to your office and give yourself an appraisal. How are you faring? Where are you falling short? What tools, information, or support might you need to do better? Some other hints: ¥ Set both smaller and larger goals so that when it comes time to evaluate yourself you've already accomplished some whole tasks. ¥ Make sure you understand how every aspect of your work relates to your larger purpose. ¥ Be brutally honest. This exercise is aimed at helping you improve performance and achieve mastery so if you rationalize failures or gloss over your mistakes instead of learning from them, you're wasting your time. And if doing this solo isn't your thing, gather a small group of colleagues for regular peer-based do-it-yourself performance reviews. If your comrades really care, they'll tell you the truth and hold you accountable. One last question for bosses: Why in God's name are you not encouraging all your employees to do this? GET UNSTUCK BY GOING OBLIQUE E ven the most intrinsically motivated person sometimes gets stuck. So here's a simple, easy, and fun way to power out of your mental morass. In 1975, producer Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt published a set of one hundred cards containing strategies that helped them overcome the pressure-packed moments that always accompany a deadline. Each card contains a single, often inscrutable, question or statement to push you out of a mental rut. (Some examples: What would your closest friend do? Your mistake was a hidden intention. What is the simplest solution? Repetition is a form of change . Don't avoid what is easy .) If you're working on a project and find yourself stymied, pull an Oblique card from the deck. These brain bombs are a great way to keep your mind open despite constraints you can't control. You can buy the deck at or follow one of the Twitter accounts inspired by the strategies, such as: . MOVE FIVE STEPS CLOSER TO MASTERY O ne key to mastery is what Florida State University psychology professor Anders Ericsson calls deliberate practice a lifelong period of . . . effort to improve performance in a specific domain. Deliberate practice isn't running a few miles each day or banging on the piano for twenty minutes each morning. It's much more purposeful, focused, and, yes, painful. Follow these steps over and over again for a decade and you just might become a master: ¥ Remember that deliberate practice has one objective: to improve performance. People who play tennis once a week for years don't get any better if they do the same thing each time, Ericsson has said. Deliberate practice is about changing your performance, setting new goals and straining yourself to reach a bit higher each time. ¥ Repeat, repeat, repeat . Repetition matters. Basketball greats don't shoot ten free throws at the end of team practice; they shoot five hundred. ¥ Seek constant, critical feedback . If you don't know how you're doing, you won't know what to improve. ¥ Focus ruthlessly on where you need help . While many of us work on what we're already good at, says Ericsson, those who get better work on their weaknesses. ¥ Prepare for the process to be mentally and physically exhausting . That's why so few people commit to it, but that's why it works. TAKE A PAGE FROM WEBBER AND A CARD FROM YOUR POCKET I n his insightful book Rules of Thumb , Fast Company magazine cofounder Alan Webber offers a smart and simple exercise for assessing whether you're on the path to autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Get a few blank three-by-five-inch cards. On one of the cards, write your answer to this question: What gets you up in the morning? Now, on the other side of the card, write your answer to another question: What keeps you up at night? Pare each response to a single sentence. And if you don't like an answer, toss the card and try again until you've crafted something you can live with. Then read what you've produced. If both answers give you a sense of meaning and direction, Congratulations! says Webber. Use them as your compass, checking from time to time to see if they're still true. If you don't like one or both of your answers, it opens up a new question: What are you going to do about it? CREATE YOUR OWN MOTIVATIONAL POSTER Office posters that try to motivate us have a grim reputation. As one wag put it, For the last two decades, motivational posters have inflicted unimaginable suffering on the workplaces of the world. But who knows? Perhaps the first one was a thing of beauty. Maybe those cave drawings in Lascaux, France, were some Paleolithic motivational speaker's way of saying, If you know where you're going, you'll never take a wrong turn. Now you've got a chance to fight back (or perhaps to reclaim that ancient legacy). Thanks to a number of websites, you can create your own motivational posters and you no longer have to settle for photos of kittens climbing out of baskets. You can be as serious or silly with this exercise as you like. Motivation is deeply personal and only you know what words or images will resonate with you. Try any of these sites: Despair Inc () Big Huge Labs () Automotivator () To offer you some, er, motivation, here are two posters I created myself: Type I for Organizations: Nine Ways to Improve Your Company, Office, or Group Whether you're the CEO or the new intern, you can help create engaging, productive workplaces that foster Type I behavior. Here are nine ways to begin pulling your organization out of the past and into the brighter world of Motivation 3.0. TRY 20 PERCENT TIME WITH TRAINING WHEELS Y ou've read about the wonders of 20 percent time where organizations encourage employees to spend one-fifth of their hours working on any project they want. And if you've ever used Gmail or read Google News, you've benefited from the results. But for all the virtues of this Type I innovation, putting such a policy in place can seem daunting. How much will it cost? What if it doesn't work? If you're feeling skittish, here's an idea: Go with a more modest version 20 percent time . . . with training wheels. Start with, say, 10 percent time. That's just one afternoon of a five-day workweek. (Who among us hasn't wasted that amount of time at work anyway?) And instead of committing to it forever, try it for six months. By creating this island of autonomy, you'll help people act on their great ideas and convert their downtime into more productive time. And who knows? Someone in your operation just might invent the next Post-it note. ENCOURAGE PEER-TO-PEER NOW THAT REWARDS K imley-Horn and Associates, a civil engineering firm in Raleigh, North Carolina, has established a reward system that gets the Type I stamp of approval: At any point, without asking permission, anyone in the company can award a $50 bonus to any of her colleagues. It works because it's real-time, and it's not handed down from any management, the firm's human resources director told Fast Company . Any employee who does something exceptional receives recognition from their peers within minutes. Because these bonuses are noncontingent now that rewards, they avoid the seven deadly flaws of most corporate carrots. And because they come from a colleague, not a boss, they carry a different (and perhaps deeper) meaning. You could even say they're motivating. CONDUCT AN AUTONOMY AUDIT H ow much autonomy do the people in your organization really have? If you're like most folks, you probably don't have a clue. Nobody does. But there's a way to find out with an autonomy audit. Ask everyone in your department or on your team to respond to these four questions with a numerical ranking (using a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 meaning almost none and 10 meaning a huge amount): 1. How much autonomy do you have over your tasks at work your main responsibilities and what you do in a given day? 2. How much autonomy do you have over your time at work for instance, when you arrive, when you leave, and how you allocate your hours each day? 3. How much autonomy do you have over your team at work that is, to what extent are you able to choose the people with whom you typically collaborate? 4. How much autonomy do you have over your technique at work how you actually perform the main responsibilities of your job? Make sure all responses are anonymous. Then tabulate the results. What's the employee average? The figure will fall somewhere on a 40-point autonomy scale (with 0 being a North Korean prison and 40 being Woodstock). Compare that number to people's perceptions. Perhaps the boss thought everyone had plenty of freedom but the audit showed an average autonomy rating of only 15. Also calculate separate results for task, time, team, and technique. A healthy overall average can sometimes mask a problem in a particular area. An overall autonomy rating of, say, 27 isn't bad. However, if that average consists of 8 each for task, technique, and team, but only 3 for time, you've identified an autonomy weak spot in the organization. It's remarkable sometimes how little the people running organizations know about the experiences of the people working around them. But it's equally remarkable how often leaders are willing to do things differently if they see real data. That's what an autonomy audit can do. And if you include a section in your audit for employees to jot down their own ideas about increasing autonomy, you might even find some great solutions. TAKE THREE STEPS TOWARD GIVING UP CONTROL T ype X bosses relish control. Type I bosses relinquish control. Extending people the freedom they need to do great work is usually wise, but it's not always easy. So if you're feeling the urge to control, here are three ways to begin letting go for your own benefit and your team's: 1. Involve people in goal-setting . Would you rather set your own goals or have them foisted upon you? Thought so. Why should those working with you be any different? A considerable body of research shows that individuals are far more engaged when they're pursuing goals they had a hand in creating. So bring employees into the process. They could surprise you: People often have higher aims than the ones you assign them. 2. Use noncontrolling language . Next time you're about to say must or should, try saying think about or consider instead. A small change in wording can help promote engagement over compliance and might even reduce some people's urge to defy. Think about it. Or at least consider it, okay? 3. Hold office hours . Sometimes you need to summon people into your office. But sometimes it's wise to let them come to you. Take a cue from college professors and set aside one or two hours a week when your schedule is clear and any employee can come in and talk to you about anything that's on her mind. Your colleagues might benefit and you might learn something. PLAY WHOSE PURPOSE IS IT ANYWAY? T his is another exercise designed to close the gap between perception and reality. Gather your team, your department, or, if you can, all the employees in your outfit. Hand everyone a blank three-by-five-inch card. Then ask each person to write down his or her one-sentence answer to the following question: What is our company's (or organization's) purpose? Collect the cards and read them aloud. What do they tell you? Are the answers similar, everyone aligned along a common purpose? Or are they all over the place some people believing one thing, others something completely different, and still others without even a guess? For all the talk about culture, alignment, and mission, most organizations do a pretty shabby job of assessing this aspect of their business. This simple inquiry can offer a glimpse into the soul of your enterprise. If people don't know why they're doing what they're doing, how can you expect them to be motivated to do it? USE REICH'S PRONOUN TEST F ormer U.S. labor secretary Robert B. Reich has devised a smart, simple, (and free) diagnostic tool for measuring the health of an organization. When he talks to employees, he listens carefully for the pronouns they use. Do employees refer to their company as they or as we? They suggests at least some amount of disengagement, and perhaps even alienation. We suggests the opposite that employees feel they're part of something significant and meaningful. If you're a boss, spend a few days listening to the people around you, not only in formal settings like meetings, but in the hallways and at lunch as well. Are you a we organization or a they organization? The difference matters. Everybody wants autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The thing is, we can get it but they can't. DESIGN FOR INTRINSIC MOTIVATION I nternet guru and author Clay Shirky () says that the most successful websites and electronic forums have a certain Type I approach in their DNA. They're designed often explicitly to tap intrinsic motivation. You can do the same with your online presence if you listen to Shirky and: ¥ Create an environment that makes people feel good about participating. ¥ Give users autonomy. ¥ Keep the system as open as possible. And what matters in cyberspace matters equally in physical space. Ask yourself: How does the built environment of your workplace promote or inhibit autonomy, mastery, and purpose? PROMOTE GOLDILOCKS FOR GROUPS A lmost everyone has experienced the satisfaction of a Goldilocks task the kind that's neither too easy nor too hard, that delivers a delicious sense of flow. But sometimes it's difficult to replicate that experience when you're working in a team. People often end up doing the jobs they always do because they've proven they can do them well, and an unfortunate few get saddled with the flow-free tasks nobody else wants. Here are a few ways to bring a little Goldilocks to your group: ¥ Begin with a diverse team . As Harvard's Teresa Amabile advises, Set up work groups so that people will stimulate each other and learn from each other, so that they're not homogeneous in terms of their backgrounds and training. You want people who can really cross-fertilize each other's ideas. ¥ Make your group a no competition zone . Pitting coworkers against one another in the hope that competition will spark them to perform better rarely works and almost always undermines intrinsic motivation. If you're going to use a c-word, go with collaboration or cooperation. ¥ Try a little task-shifting . If someone is bored with his current assignment, see if he can train someone else in the skills he's already mastered. Then see if he can take on some aspect of a more experienced team member's work. ¥ Animate with purpose, don't motivate with rewards . Nothing bonds a team like a shared mission. The more that people share a common cause whether it's creating something insanely great, outperforming an outside competitor, or even changing the world the more your group will do deeply satisfying and outstanding work. TURN YOUR NEXT OFF-SITE INTO A FEDEX DAY B ehold the company off-site, a few spirit-sapping days of forced fun and manufactured morale featuring awkward pep talks, wretched dancing, and a few trust falls. To be fair, some off-sites reengage employees, recharge people's batteries, and restart conversations on big issues. But if your organization's off-sites are falling short, why not try replacing the next one with a FedEx Day? Set aside an entire day where employees can work on anything they choose, however they want, with whomever they'd like. Make sure they have the tools and resources they need. And impose just one rule: People must deliver something a new idea, a prototype of a product, a better internal process the following day. Type I organizations know what their Type X counterparts rarely comprehend: Real challenges are far more invigorating than controlled leisure. The Zen of Compensation: Paying People the Type I Way Everybody wants to be paid well. I sure do. I bet you're the same. The Type I approach to motivation doesn't require bargain basement wages or an all-volunteer workforce, but it does demand a new approach to pay. Think of this new approach as the Zen of compensation: In Motivation 3.0, the best use of money is to take the issue of money off the table. The more prominent salary, perks, and benefits are in someone's work life, the more they can inhibit creativity and unravel performance. As Edward Deci explained in Chapter 3, when organizations use rewards like money to motivate staff, that's when they're most demotivating. The better strategy is to get compensation right and then get it out of sight. Effective organizations compensate people in amounts and in ways that allow individuals to mostly forget about compensation and instead focus on the work itself. Here are three key techniques. 1. ENSURE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FAIRNESS T he most important aspect of any compensation package is fairness. And here, fairness comes in two varieties internal and external. Internal fairness means paying people commensurate with their colleagues. External fairness means paying people in line with others doing similar work in similar organizations. Let's look at each type of fairness. Suppose you and Fred have adjoining cubicles. And suppose you've got pretty much equivalent responsibility and experience. If Fred makes scads more money than you, you'll be miffed. Because of this violation of internal fairness, your motivation will plummet. Now suppose instead that you and Fred are both auditors with ten years' experience working in a Fortune 200 company. If you discover that similarly experienced auditors at other Fortune 200 firms are making double your salaries, both you and Fred will experience a largely irreversible motivation dip. The company has violated the ethic of external fairness. (One important addendum: Paying people the Type I way doesn't mean paying everyone the same amount. If Fred has a harder job or contributes more to the organization than you, he deserves a richer deal. And, as it turns out, several studies have shown that most people don't have a beef with that. Why? It's fair.) Getting the internal and external equity right isn't itself a motivator. But it is a way to avoid putting the issue of money back on the table and making it a de- motivator. 2. PAY MORE THAN AVERAGE I f you have provided adequate baseline rewards and established internal and external fairness, consider borrowing a strategy first surfaced by a Nobel laureate. In the mid-1980s, George Akerlof, who later won the Nobel Prize in economics, and his wife, Janet Yellen, who's also an economist, discovered that some companies seemed to be overpaying their workers. Instead of paying employees the wages that supply and demand would have predicted, they gave their workers a little more. It wasn't because the companies were selfless and it wasn't because they were stupid. It was because they were savvy. Paying great people a little more than the market demands, Akerlof and Yellen found, could attract better talent, reduce turnover, and boost productivity and morale. Higher wages could actually reduce a company's costs. The pay-more-than-average approach can offer an elegant way to bypass if-then rewards, eliminate concerns about unfairness, and help take the issue of money off the table. It's another way to allow people to focus on the work itself. Indeed, other economists have shown that providing an employee a high level of base pay does more to boost performance and organizational commitment than an attractive bonus structure. Of course, by the very nature of the exercise, paying above the average will work for only about half of you. So get going before your competitors do. 3. IF YOU USE PERFORMANCE METRICS, MAKE THEM WIDE-RANGING, RELEVANT, AND HARD TO GAME I magine you're a product manager and your pay depends largely on reaching a particular sales goal for the next quarter. If you're smart, or if you've got a family to feed, you're going to try mightily to hit that number. You probably won't concern yourself much with the quarter after that or the health of the company or whether the firm is investing enough in research and development. And if you're nervous, you might cut corners to reach your quarterly goal. Now imagine you're a product manager and your pay is determined by these factors: your sales for the next quarter; your sales in the current year; the company's revenue and profit in the next two years; levels of satisfaction among your customers; ideas for new products; and evaluations of your coworkers. If you're smart, you'll probably try to sell your product, serve your customers, help your teammates, and, well, do good work. When metrics are varied, they're harder to finagle. In addition, the gain for reaching the metrics shouldn't be too large. When the payoff for reaching targets is modest, rather than massive, it's less likely to narrow people's focus or encourage them to take the low road. To be sure, finding the right mix of metrics is difficult and will vary considerably across organizations. And some people will inevitably find a way to game even the most carefully calibrated system. But using a variety of measures that reflect the totality of great work can transform often counterproductive if-then rewards into less combustible now that rewards. Type I for Parents and Educators: Nine Ideas for Helping Our Kids All kids start out as curious, self-directed Type I's. But many of them end up as disengaged, compliant Type X's. What's going on? Maybe the problem is us the adults who are running schools and heading families. If we want to equip young people for the new world of work and, more important, if we want them to lead satisfying lives we need to break Motivation 2.0's grip on education and parenting. Unfortunately, as with business, there's a mismatch between what science knows and what schools do. Science knows (and you do, too, if you read Chapter 2) that if you promise a preschooler a fancy certificate for drawing a picture, that child will likely draw a picture for you and then lose further interest in drawing. Yet in the face of this evidence and as the world economy demands more nonroutine, creative, conceptual abilities too many schools are moving in the wrong direction. They're redoubling their emphasis on routines, right answers, and standardization. And they're hauling out a wagon full of if-then rewards pizza for reading books, iPods for showing up to class, cash for good test scores. We're bribing students into compliance instead of challenging them into engagement. We can do better. And we should. If we want to raise Type I kids, at school and at home, we need to help them move toward autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Here are nine ways to start the journey. APPLY THE THREE-PART TYPE I TEST FOR HOMEWORK D oes the homework bulging from kids' backpacks truly help them learn? Or does it simply steal their free time in the service of a false sense of rigor? Teachers, before you dole out yet another time-consuming assignment, run it through this Type I homework test by asking yourself three questions: ¥ Am I offering students any autonomy over how and when to do this work? ¥ Does this assignment promote mastery by offering a novel, engaging task (as opposed to rote reformulation of something already covered in class)? ¥ Do my students understand the purpose of this assignment? That is, can they see how doing this additional activity at home contributes to the larger enterprise in which the class is engaged? If the answer to any of these questions is no, can you refashion the assignment? And parents, are you looking at homework assignments every so often to see whether they promote compliance or engagement? Let's not waste our kids' time on meaningless exercises. With a little thought and effort, we can then home work into home learning . HAVE A FEDEX DAY I n Chapter 4, we learned how the software company Atlassian injects a burst of autonomy into its workplace by setting aside a day each quarter when employees can work on any project they choose, however they want, with whomever they'd like. Why not try this with your students or even your own sons and daughters? Set aside an entire school day (or a family vacation day) and ask kids to come up with a problem to solve or a project to tackle. In advance, help them collect the tools, information, and supplies they might need. Then let them have at it. The next morning, ask them to deliver by reporting back to the class or the family on their discoveries and experiences. It's like Project Runway only the kids come up with the project themselves, and the reward at the end of the day is the chance to share what they've created and all they've learned along the way. TRY DIY REPORT CARDS T oo many students walk through the schoolhouse door with one aim in mind: to get good grades. And all too often, the best way to reach this goal is to get with the program, avoid risks, and serve up the answers the teacher wants the way the teacher wants them. Good grades become a reward for compliance but don't have much to do with learning. Meanwhile, students whose grades don't measure up often see themselves as failures and give up trying to learn. The Type I approach is different. Report cards are not a potential prize, but a way to offer students useful feedback on their progress. And Type I students understand that a great way to get feedback is to evaluate their own progress. So try experimenting with the DIY (do it yourself ) report card. At the beginning of a semester, ask students to list their top learning goals. Then, at the end of the semester, ask them to create their own report card along with a one- or two-paragraph review of their progress. Where did they succeed? Where did they fall short? What more do they need to learn? Once students have completed their DIY report cards, show them the teacher's report card, and let the comparison of the two be the start of a conversation on how they are doing on their path toward mastery. Maybe even include students in any parent-teacher conferences. (Parents: If your child's teacher won't go for these DIY report cards, try it yourself at home. It's another way to prevent school from changing your child's default setting and turning him from Type I to Type X.) GIVE YOUR KIDS AN ALLOWANCE AND SOME CHORES BUT DON'T COMBINE THEM H ere's why an allowance is good for kids: Having a little of their own money, and deciding how to save or spend it, offers a measure of autonomy and teaches them to be responsible with cash. Here's why household chores are good for kids: Chores show kids that families are built on mutual obligations and that family members need to help each other. Here's why combining allowances with chores is not good for kids. By linking money to the completion of chores, parents turn an allowance into an if-then reward. This sends kids a clear (and clearly wrongheaded) message: In the absence of a payment, no self-respecting child would willingly set the table, empty the garbage, or make her own bed. It converts a moral and familial obligation into just another commercial transaction and teaches that the only reason to do a less-than-desirable task for your family is in exchange for payment. This is a case where combining two good things give you less, not more. So keep allowance and chores separate, and you just might get that trash can emptied. Even better, your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs. OFFER PRAISE . . . THE RIGHT WAY D one right, praise is an important way to give kids feedback and encouragement. But done wrong, praise can become yet another if-then reward that can squash creativity and stifle intrinsic motivation. The powerful work of psychologist Carol Dweck, as well as others in the field, offers a how-to list for offering praise in a way that promotes Type I behavior: ¥ Praise effort and strategy, not intelligence . As Dweck's research has shown, children who are praised for being smart often believe that every encounter is a test of whether they really are. So to avoid looking dumb, they resist new challenges and choose the easiest path. By contrast, kids who understand that effort and hard work lead to mastery and growth are more willing to take on new, difficult tasks. ¥ Make praise specific . Parents and teachers should give kids useful information about their performance. Instead of bathing them in generalities, tell them specifically what they've done that's noteworthy. ¥ Praise in private . Praise is feedback not an award ceremony. That's why it's often best to offer it one-on-one, in private. ¥ Offer praise only when there's a good reason for it . Don't kid a kid. He can see through fake praise in a nanosecond. Be sincere or keep quiet. If you overpraise, kids regard it as dishonest and unearned. Plus, overpraising becomes another if-then reward that makes earning praise, rather than moving toward mastery, the objective. HELP KIDS SEE THE BIG PICTURE I n education systems tilted toward standardized tests, grades, and if-then rewards, students often have no idea why they're doing what they're doing. Turn that around by helping them glimpse the big picture. Whatever they're studying, be sure they can answer these questions: Why am I learning this? How is it relevant to the world I live in now? Then get out of the classroom and apply what they're studying. If they're learning Spanish, take them to an office, a store, or a community center where they can actually speak the language. If they're studying geometry, have them draw up architectural plans for an addition to your school or home. If they're taking history, ask them to apply what they've learned to an event in the news. Think of it as the fourth R: reading, writing, arithmetic . . . and relevance. CHECK OUT THESE FIVE TYPE I SCHOOLS A lthough most schools around the world are still built atop the Motivation 2.0 operating system, a number of forward-thinking educators have long understood that young people are brimming with the third drive. Here are five Type I schools in the United States with practices to emulate and stories to inspire. ¥ Big Picture Learning . Since 1996, with the opening of its flagship public high school, the Met, in Providence, Rhode Island, Big Picture Learning has been creating places that cultivate engagement rather than demand compliance. Founded by two veteran education innovators, Dennis Littky and Elliot Washor, Big Picture is a nonprofit that now has sixty-plus schools around the United States that put students in charge of their own education. Big Picture kids get the basics. But they also use those basics and acquire other skills by doing real work in the community all under the guidance of an experienced adult tutor. And instead of easily gamed Motivation 2.0 measurements, Big Picture kids are assessed the way adults are on work performance, individual presentations, effort, attitude, and behavior on the job. Most of the students at the Met and other Big Picture schools are at risk low-income and minority kids who've been poorly served by conventional schools. Yet thanks to this innovative Type I approach, more than 95 percent graduate and go on to college. For more information, go to . (Full disclosure: I have served, unpaid, on the board of directors of Big Picture since 2007.) ¥ Sudbury Valley School . Take a look at this independent school in Framingham, Massachusetts, to see what happens when young kids have genuine autonomy. Working from the assumption that all human beings are naturally curious and that the best kind of learning happens when it's initiated and pursued by the one doing the learning, Sudbury Valley School gives its students total control over the task, time, and technique of their learning. Teachers and staff are there to help them make things happen. This is a school where engagement is the rule and compliance isn't an option. For more information, go to . ¥ The Tinkering School . More of a lab than a school, this summer program, created by computer scientist Gever Tulley, lets children from seven to seventeen play around with interesting stuff and build cool things. At the headquarters in Montara, California, Tulley's tinkerers have built: working zip-lines, motorcycles, toothbrush robots, roller coasters, and plastic bag bridges strong enough to hold people. Most of us aren't able to ship our kids out to California for a week of tinkering, but we can all learn the Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do. So take nine minutes to listen to Tulley's 2007 online TED Talk of that title. Then hand your kids a pocket-knife, some power tools, and a book of matches and get out of the way. For more information, go to (includes a link to Tulley's talk). ¥ Puget Sound Community School . Like Sudbury and Big Picture, this tiny independent school in Seattle, Washington, gives its students a radical dose of autonomy, turning the one size fits all approach of conventional schools on its head. Each student has an adviser who acts as her personal coach, helping her come up with her own learning goals. School consists of a mixture of class time and self-created independent study projects, along with community service devised by the students. Since youngsters are often away from campus, they gain a clear sense that their learning has a real-world purpose. And rather than chase after grades, they receive frequent, informal feedback from advisers, teachers, and peers. For more information, go to . ¥ Montessori Schools . Dr. Maria Montessori developed the Montessori method of teaching in the early 1900s after observing children's natural curiosity and innate desire to learn. Her early understanding of the third drive spawned a worldwide network of schools, mostly for preschool and primary-aged children. Many of the key tenets of a Montessori education resonate with the principles of Motivation 3.0 that children naturally engage in self-directed learning and independent study; that teachers should act as observers and facilitators of that learning, and not as lecturers or commanders; and that children are naturally inclined to experience periods of intense focus, concentration, and flow that adults should do their best not to interrupt. Although Montessori schools are rare at the junior high and high school levels, every school, educator, and parent can learn from its enduring and successful approach. Meantime, while you're investigating Montessori, check out two other approaches to learning that also promote Type I behavior: the Reggio Emilia philosophy for the education of young children and the Waldorf schools. For more information, visit these websites: , , , , and . TAKE A CLASS FROM THE UNSCHOOLERS I n the United States, the homeschooling movement has been growing at a remarkable pace over the past twenty years. And the fastest-growing segment of that movement is the unschoolers families that don't use a formal curriculum and instead allow their children to explore and learn what interests them. Unschoolers have been among the first to adopt a Type I approach to education. They promote autonomy by allowing youngsters to decide what they learn and how they learn it. They encourage mastery by allowing children to spend as long as they'd like and to go as deep as they desire on the topics that interest them. Even if unschooling is not for you or your kids, you can learn a thing or two from these educational innovators. Start by reading John Taylor Gatto's extraordinary book, Dumbing Us Down . Take a look at Home Education Magazine and its website. Then check out some of the many other unschooling sites on the Web. For more information, go to , , and . TURN STUDENTS INTO TEACHERS O ne of the best ways to know whether you've mastered something is to try to teach it. Give students that opportunity. Assign each pupil in a class a different aspect of the broader topic you're studying and then have them take turns teaching what they've learned to their classmates. And once they've got it down, give them a wider audience by inviting other classes, teachers, parents, or school administrators to learn what they have to teach. Also, at the start of a school term, ask students about their individual passions and areas of expertise. Keep a list of your experts, and then call upon them as needed throughout the term. A classroom of teachers is a classroom of learners. The Type I Reading List: Fifteen Essential Books Autonomy, mastery, and purpose are integral to the human condition, so it's no surprise that a number of writers from psychologists to journalists to novelists have explored these three elements and probed what they mean for our lives. This list of books, arranged alphabetically by author, isn't exhaustive but it's a good starting point for anyone interested in cultivating a Type I life. Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility BY JAMES P. CARSE In his elegant little book, religious scholar Carse describes two types of games. A finite game has a winner and an end; the goal is to triumph. An infinite game has no winner and no end; the goal is to keep playing. Nonwinnable games, Carse explains, are much more rewarding than the win-lose ones we're accustomed to playing at our work and in our relationships. Type I Insight : Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries. Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else BY GEOFF COLVIN What's the difference between those who are pretty good at what they do and those who are masters? Fortune magazine's Colvin scours the evidence and shows that the answer is threefold: practice, practice, practice. But it's not just any practice, he says. The secret is deliberate practice highly repetitive, mentally demanding work that's often unpleasant, but undeniably effective. Type I Insight : If you set a goal of becoming an expert in your business, you would immediately start doing all kinds of things you don't do now. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience BY MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI It's tough to find a better argument for working hard at something you love than Csikszentmihalyi's landmark book on optimal experiences. Flow describes those exhilarating moments when we feel in control, full of purpose, and in the zone. And it reveals how people have turned even the most unpleasant tasks into enjoyable, rewarding challenges. Type I Insight : Contrary to what we usually believe . . . the best moments in our lives are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to the limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. For more of Csikszentmihalyi's ideas, check out three of his other books: Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life; Creativity: Flow and the Psychology of Discovery and Invention; and the classic Beyond Boredom and Anxiety: Experiencing Flow in Work and Play. Why We Do What We Do: Understanding Self-Motivation BY EDWARD L. DECI WITH RICHARD FLASTE In 1995, Edward Deci wrote a short book that introduced his powerful theories to a popular audience. In clear, readable prose, he discusses the limitations of a society based on control, explains the origins of his landmark experiments, and shows how to promote autonomy in the many realms of our lives. Type I Insight : The questions so many people ask namely, ÔHow do I motivate people to learn? to work? to do their chores? or to take their medicine?' are the wrong questions. They are wrong because they imply that motivation is something that gets done to people rather than something that people do. Mindset: The New Psychology of Success BY CAROL DWECK Stanford's Dweck distills her decades of research to a simple pair of ideas. People can have two different mindsets, she says. Those with a fixed mindset believe that their talents and abilities are carved in stone. Those with a growth mindset believe that their talents and abilities can be developed. Fixed mindsets see every encounter as a test of their worthiness. Growth mindsets see the same encounters as opportunities to improve. Dweck's message: Go with growth. Type I Insight : In the book and likewise on her website, , Dweck offers concrete steps for moving from a fixed to a growth mindset: ¥ Learn to listen for a fixed mindset voice that might be hurting your resiliency. ¥ Interpret challenges not as roadblocks, but as opportunities to stretch yourself. ¥ Use the language of growth for example, I'm not sure I can do it now, but I think I can learn with time and effort. Then We Came to the End BY JOSHUA FERRIS This darkly hilarious debut novel is a cautionary tale for the demoralizing effects of the Type X workplace. At an unnamed ad agency in Chicago, people spend more time scarfing free doughnuts and scamming office chairs than doing actual work all while fretting about walking Spanish down the hall, office lingo for being fired. Type I Insight : They had taken away our flowers, our summer days, and our bonuses, we were on a wage freeze and a hiring freeze and people were flying out the door like so many dismantled dummies. We had one thing still going for us: the prospect of a promotion. A new title: true, it came with no money, the power was almost always illusory, the bestowal a cheap shrewd device concocted by management to keep us from mutiny, but when word circulated that one of us had jumped up an acronym, that person was just a little quieter that day, took a longer lunch than usual, came back with shopping bags, spent the afternoon speaking softly into the telephone, and left whenever they wanted that night, while the rest of us sent emails flying back and forth on the lofty topics of Injustice and Uncertainty. Good Work: When Excellence and Ethics Meet BY HOWARD GARDNER, MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI, AND WILLIAM DAMON How can you do good work in an age of relentless market forces and lightning-fast technology? By considering three basic issues: your profession's mission , its standards or best practices, and your own identity . Although this book focuses mainly on examples from the fields of genetics and journalism, its insights can be applied to a number of professions buffeted by changing times. The authors have also continued their effort to identify individuals and institutions that exemplify good work on their website: . Type I Insight : What do you do if you wake up in the morning and dread going to work, because the daily routine no longer satisfies your standards? ¥ Start groups or forums with others in your industry or outside it to reach beyond your current area of influence. ¥ Work with existing organizations to confirm your profession's values or develop new guidelines. ¥ Take a stand. It can be risky, sure, but leaving a job for ethical reasons need not involve abandoning your professional goals. Outliers: The Story of Success BY MALCOLM GLADWELL With a series of compelling and gracefully told stories, Gladwell deftly takes a hammer to the idea of the self-made man. Success is more complicated, he says. High achievers from young Canadian hockey players to Bill Gates to the Beatles are often the products of hidden advantages of culture, timing, demographics, and luck that helped them become masters in their fields. Reading this book will lead you to reevaluate your own path. More important, it will make you wonder how much human potential we're losing when so many people are denied these advantages. Type I Insight : It is not how much money we make that ultimately makes us happy between nine-to-five. It's whether our work fulfills us. If I offered you a choice between being an architect for $75,000 a year and working in a tollbooth every day for the rest of your life for $100,000 a year, which would you take? I'm guessing the former, because there is complexity, autonomy, and a relationship between effort and reward in doing creative work, and that's worth more to most of us than money. Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln BY DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN In her entertaining popular history, Goodwin shows Abraham Lincoln as an exemplar of Type I behavior. He worked mightily to achieve mastery in law and politics. He gave his staunchest rivals power and autonomy. And he developed a leadership style rooted in a higher purpose ending slavery and keeping the union intact. Type I Insight : Goodwin sheds light on Lincoln's Type I leadership skills. Among them: ¥ He was self-confident enough to surround himself with rivals who excelled in areas where he was weak. ¥ He genuinely listened to other people's points of view, which helped him form more complex opinions of his own. ¥ He gave credit where it was due and wasn't afraid to take the blame. The Amateurs: The Story of Four Young Men and Their Quest for an Olympic Gold Medal BY DAVID HALBERSTAM What would compel a group of men to endure untold physical pain and exhaustion for a sport that promised no monetary compensation or fame? That's the question at the heart of Halberstam's riveting narrative about the 1984 U.S. rowing trials, a book that offers a glimpse into the fires of intrinsic motivation. Type I Insight : No chartered planes or buses ferried the athletes into Princeton. No team managers hustled their baggage from the bus to the hotel desk and made arrangements so that at mealtime they need only show up and sign a tab. This was a world of hitched rides and borrowed beds, and meals, if not scrounged, were desperately budgeted by appallingly hungry young men. Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes BY ALFIE KOHN Former teacher Kohn throws down the gauntlet at society's blind acceptance of B. F. Skinner's Do this and you'll get that theory of behaviorism. This 1993 book ranges across school, work, and private life in its indictment of extrinsic motivators and paints a compelling picture of a world without them. Type I Insight : Do rewards motivate people? Absolutely. They motivate people to get rewards. Kohn has written eleven books on parenting, education, and behavior as well as scores of articles on that topic all of which are interesting and provocative. There's more information on his website: . Once a Runner BY JOHN L. PARKER, JR. Parker's novel, originally published in 1978 and kept alive by a devoted coterie of fans, offers a fascinating look into the psychology of distance running. Through the tale of college miler Quenton Cassidy, we see the toll that mastery can take and the thrill it can produce when it's realized. Type I Insight : He ran not for crypto-religious reasons but to win races, to cover ground fast. Not only to be better than his fellows, but better than himself. To be faster by a tenth of a second, by an inch, by two feet or two yards, than he had been the week or year before. He sought to conquer the physical limitations placed on him by a three-dimensional world (and if Time is the fourth dimension, that too was his province). If he could conquer the weakness, the cowardice in himself, he would not worry about the rest; it would come. The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Win Your Inner Creative Battles BY STEVEN PRESSFIELD Pressfield's potent book is both a wise meditation on the obstacles that stand in the way of creative freedom and a spirited battle plan for overcoming the resistance that arises when we set out to do something great. If you're looking for a quick jolt on your journey toward mastery, this is it. Type I Insight : It may be that the human race is not ready for freedom. The air of liberty may be too rarified for us to breathe. Certainly I wouldn't be writing this book, on this subject, if living with freedom were easy. The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demonstrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them. Maverick: The Success Story Behind the World's Most Unusual Workplace BY RICARDO SEMLER While many bosses are control freaks, Semler might be the first autonomy freak. He transformed the Brazilian manufacturing firm Semco through a series of radical steps. He canned most executives, eliminated job titles, let the company's three thousand employees set their own hours, gave everyone a vote in big decisions, and even let some workers determine their own salaries. The result: Under Semler's (non)command, Semco has grown 20 percent a year for the past two decades. This book, along with Semler's more recent The Seven-Day Weekend , shows how to put his iconoclastic and effective philosophy into action. Type I Insight: I want everyone at Semco to be self-sufficient. The company is organized well, maybe that's not quite the right word for us not to depend too much on any individual, especially me. I take it as a point of pride that twice on my return from long trips my office had been moved and each time it got smaller. The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization BY PETER M. SENGE In his management classic , Senge introduces readers to learning organizations where autonomous thinking and shared visions for the future are not only encouraged, but are considered vital to the health of the organization. Senge's five disciplines offer a smart organizational companion to Type I behavior. Type I Insight : People with a high level of personal mastery are able to consistently realize the results that matter most deeply to them in effect, they approach their life as an artist would approach a work of art. They do that by becoming committed to their own lifelong learning. Listen to the Gurus: Six Business Thinkers Who Get It While the list of companies that embrace Type I thinking is distressingly short, the blueprints for building such organizations are readily available. The following six business thinkers offer some wise guidance for designing organizations that promote autonomy, mastery, and purpose. DOUGLAS MCGREGOR Who: A social psychologist and one of the first professors at MIT's Sloan School of Management. His landmark 1960 book, The Human Side of Enterprise , gave the practice of management a badly needed shot of humanism. Big Idea: Theory X vs. Theory Y. McGregor described two very different approaches to management, each based on a different assumption about human behavior. The first approach, which he called Theory X , assumed that people avoid effort, work only for money and security, and therefore need to be controlled . The second, which he called Theory Y, assumed that work is as natural for human beings as play or rest, that initiative and creativity are widespread, and that if people are committed to a goal, they will actually seek responsibility. Theory Y, he argued, was the more accurate and ultimately more effective approach. Type I Insight: Managers frequently complain to me about the fact that subordinates Ônowadays' won't take responsibility. I have been interested to note how often these same managers keep a constant surveillance over the day-to-day performance of subordinates, sometimes two or three levels below themselves. More Info: As I explained in Chapter 3, The Human Side of Enterprise is a key ancestor of Motivation 3.0. Although McGregor wrote the book a full fifty years ago, his observations about the limits of control remain smart, fresh, and relevant. PETER F. DRUCKER Who: The most influential management thinker of the twentieth century. He wrote an astonishing forty-one books, influenced the thinking of two generations of CEOs, received a U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, and taught for three decades at the Claremont Graduate University Business School that now bears his name. Big Idea: Self-management. Drucker's primary contribution is not a single idea, Jim Collins once wrote, but rather an entire body of work that has one gigantic advantage: nearly all of it is essentially right. Drucker coined the term knowledge worker, foresaw the rise of the nonprofit sector, and was among the first to stress the primacy of the customer in business strategy. But although he's best known for his thoughts on managing businesses, toward the end of his career Drucker signaled the next frontier: self-management . With the rise of individual longevity and the decline of job security, he argued, individuals have to think hard about where their strengths lie, what they can contribute, and how they can improve their own performance. The need to manage oneself, he wrote shortly before he died in 2005, is creating a revolution in human affairs. Type I Insight: Demanding of knowledge workers that they define their own task and its results is necessary because knowledge workers must be autonomous . . . workers should be asked to think through their own work plans and then to submit them. What am I going to focus on? What results can be expected for which I should be held accountable? By what deadline? More Info: Drucker wrote many books, and many have been written about him, but a great starting place is The Daily Drucker, a small gem that provides 366 insights and action points for putting his ideas into practice. On the topic of self-management, read Drucker's 2005 Harvard Business Review article, Managing Oneself. For more information and access to digital archives of his writing, check out . JIM COLLINS Who: One of the most authoritative voices in business today and the author of Built to Last (with Jerry Porras), Good to Great, and, most recently, How the Mighty Fall. A former professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, he now operates his own management lab in Boulder, Colorado. Big Idea: Self-motivation and greatness . Expending energy trying to motivate people is largely a waste of time, Collins wrote in Good to Great. If you have the right people on the bus, they will be self-motivated. The real question then becomes: How do you manage in such a way as not to de-motivate people? Type I Insight: Collins suggests four basic practices for creating a culture where self-motivation can flourish: 1. Lead with questions, not answers. 2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion. 3. Conduct autopsies, without blame. 4. Build Ôred flag' mechanisms. In other words, make it easy for employees and customers to speak up when they identify a problem. More Info: Collins's website, , contains more information about his work, as well as excellent diagnostic tools, guides, and videos. CALI RESSLER AND JODY THOMPSON Who: These two former human resources professionals at Best Buy persuaded their CEO to experiment with a radical new approach to organizing work. They wrote a book about their experiences, Why Work Sucks and How to Fix It , and now run their own consultancy. Big Idea: The results-only work environment. ROWE, described in Chapter 4, affords employees complete autonomy over when, where, and how they do their work. The only thing that matters is results. Type I Insight: Among the basic tenets of ROWE: People at all levels stop doing any activity that is a waste of their time, the customer's time, or their company's time. Employees have the freedom to work any way they want. Every meeting is optional. There are no work schedules. More Info: You can learn more about ROWE at their website: . GARY HAMEL Who: The world's leading expert on business strategy, according to BusinessWeek . He's the coauthor of the influential book Competing for the Future , a professor of the London Business School, and the director of the California-based MLab, where he's spearheading the pursuit of moon shots for management a set of huge challenges to reform the theory and practice of running organizations. Big Idea: Management is an outdated technology. Hamel likens management to the internal combustion engine a technology that has largely stopped evolving. Put a 1960s-era CEO in a time machine and transport him to 2010, Hamel says, and that CEO would find a great many of today's management rituals little changed from those that governed corporate life a generation or two ago. Small wonder, Hamel explains. Most of the essential tools and techniques of modern management were invented by individuals born in the 19th century, not long after the end of the American Civil War. The solution? A radical overhaul of this aging technology. Type I Insight: The next time you're in a meeting and folks are discussing how to wring another increment of performance out of your workforce, you might ask: ÔTo what end, and to whose benefit, are our employees being asked to give of themselves? Have we committed ourselves to a purpose that is truly deserving of their initiative, imagination, and passion?' More Info: Hamel's The Future of Management (written with Bill Breen) is an important read. For more on Hamel's ideas and research, see and . The Type I Fitness Plan: Four Tips for Getting (and Staying) Motivated to Exercise On the jacket of this book is a runner and that's no accident. Running can have all the elements of Type I behavior. It's autonomous. It allows you to seek mastery. And the people who keep at it, and enjoy it most, often run toward a greater purpose testing their limits or staying healthy and vital. To help you bring the spirit of intrinsic motivation out of the office and classroom and into another realm of your life, here are four tips for staying fit the Type I way. Set your own goals . Don't accept some standardized, cookie-cutter exercise plan. Create one that's tailored to your needs and fitness level. (You can work with a professional on this, but you make the final calls.) Equally important, set the right kinds of goals. Ample research in behavioral science shows that people who seek to lose weight for extrinsic reasons to slim down for a wedding or to look better at a class reunion often reach their goals. And then they gain the weight back as soon as the target event ends. Meanwhile, people who pursue more intrinsic goals to get fit in order to feel good or to stay healthy for their family make slower progress at first, but achieve significantly better results in the long term. Ditch the treadmill. Unless you really like treadmills, that is. If trudging to the gym feels like a dreary obligation, find a form of fitness you enjoy that produces those intoxicating moments of flow. Gather some friends for an informal game of tennis or basketball, join an amateur league, go for walks at a local park, dance for a half-hour, or play with your kids. Use the Sawyer Effect to your advantage and turn your work(out) into play. Keep mastery in mind. Getting better at something provides a great source of renewable energy. So pick an activity in which you can improve over time. By continually increasing the difficulty of what you take on think Goldilocks and setting more audacious challenges for yourself as time passes, you can renew that energy and stay motivated. Reward yourself the right way. If you're really struggling, consider a quick experiment with Stickk (), a website in which you publicly commit to a goal and must hand over money to a friend, a charity, or an anti-charity if you fail to reach it. But in general, don't bribe yourself with if-then rewards like If I exercise four times this week, then I'll buy myself a new shirt. They can backfire. But the occasional now that reward? Not a problem. So if you've swum the distance you hoped to this week, there's no harm in treating yourself to a massage afterward. It won't hurt. And it might feel good. Drive : The Recap This book has covered a lot of ground and you might not be able to instantly recall everything in it. So here you'll find three different summaries of Drive . Think of it as your talking points, refresher course, or memory jogger. TWITTER SUMMARY Carrots & sticks are so last century. Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery & purpose. COCKTAIL PARTY SUMMARY When it comes to motivation, there's a gap between what science knows and what business does. Our current business operating system which is built around external, carrot-and-stick motivators doesn't work and often does harm. We need an upgrade. And the science shows the way. This new approach has three essential elements: (1) Autonomy the desire to direct our own lives; (2) Mastery the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and (3) Purpose the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.",

        "text": "CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER SUMMARY Introduction: The Puzzling Puzzles of Harry Harlow and Edward Deci Human beings have a biological drive that includes hunger, thirst, and sex. We also have another long-recognized drive: to respond to rewards and punishments in our environment. But in the middle of the twentieth century, a few scientists began discovering that humans also have a third drive what some call intrinsic motivation. For several decades, behavioral scientists have been figuring out the dynamics and explaining the power of our third drive. Alas, business hasn't caught up to this new understanding. If we want to strengthen our companies, elevate our lives, and improve the world, we need to close the gap between what science knows and what business does. PART ONE. A NEW OPERATING SYSTEM Chapter 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0 Societies, like computers, have operating systems a set of mostly invisible instructions and protocols on which everything runs. The first human operating system call it Motivation 1.0 was all about survival. Its successor, Motivation 2.0, was built around external rewards and punishments. That worked fine for routine twentieth-century tasks. But in the twenty-first century, Motivation 2.0 is proving incompatible with how we organize what we do, how we think about what we do, and how we do what we do. We need an upgrade. Chapter 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work . . . When carrots and sticks encounter our third drive, strange things begin to happen. Traditional if-then rewards can give us less of what we want: They can extinguish intrinsic motivation, diminish performance, crush creativity, and crowd out good behavior. They can also give us more of what we don't want: They can encourage unethical behavior, create addictions, and foster short-term thinking. These are the bugs in our current operating system. Chapter 2a. . . . and the Special Circumstances When They Do Carrots and sticks aren't all bad. They can be effective for rule-based routine tasks because there's little intrinsic motivation to undermine and not much creativity to crush. And they can be more effective still if those giving such rewards offer a rationale for why the task is necessary, acknowledge that it's boring, and allow people autonomy over how they complete it. For nonroutine conceptual tasks, rewards are more perilous particularly those of the if-then variety. But now that rewards noncontingent rewards given after a task is complete can sometimes be okay for more creative, right-brain work, especially if they provide useful information about performance. Chapter 3. Type I and Type X Motivation 2.0 depended on and fostered Type X behavior behavior fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones and concerned less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which an activity leads. Motivation 3.0, the upgrade that's necessary for the smooth functioning of twenty-first-century business, depends on and fosters Type I behavior. Type I behavior concerns itself less with the external rewards an activity brings and more with the inherent satisfaction of the activity itself. For professional success and personal fulfillment, we need to move ourselves and our colleagues from Type X to Type I. The good news is that Type I's are made, not born and Type I behavior leads to stronger performance, greater health, and higher overall well-being. PART TWO. THE THREE ELEMENTS Chapter 4. Autonomy Our default setting is to be autonomous and self-directed. Unfortunately, circumstances including outdated notions of management often conspire to change that default setting and turn us from Type I to Type X. To encourage Type I behavior, and the high performance it enables, the first requirement is autonomy. People need autonomy over task (what they do), time (when they do it), team (who they do it with), and technique (how they do it). Companies that offer autonomy, sometimes in radical doses, are outperforming their competitors. Chapter 5. Mastery While Motivation 2.0 required compliance, Motivation 3.0 demands engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery becoming better at something that matters. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential to making one's way in the economy. Mastery begins with flow optimal experiences when the challenges we face are exquisitely matched to our abilities. Smart workplaces therefore supplement day-to-day activities with Goldilocks tasks not too hard and not too easy. But mastery also abides by three peculiar rules. Mastery is a mindset: It requires the capacity to see your abilities not as finite, but as infinitely improvable. Mastery is a pain: It demands effort, grit, and deliberate practice. And mastery is an asymptote: It's impossible to fully realize, which makes it simultaneously frustrating and alluring. Chapter 6. Purpose Humans, by their nature, seek purpose a cause greater and more enduring than themselves. But traditional businesses have long considered purpose ornamental a perfectly nice accessory, so long as it didn't get in the way of the important things. But that's changing thanks in part to the rising tide of aging baby boomers reckoning with their own mortality. In Motivation 3.0, purpose maximization is taking its place alongside profit maximization as an aspiration and a guiding principle. Within organizations, this new purpose motive is expressing itself in three ways: in goals that use profit to reach purpose; in words that emphasize more than self-interest; and in policies that allow people to pursue purpose on their own terms. This move to accompany profit maximization with purpose maximization has the potential to rejuvenate our businesses and remake our world.",

        "text": "Drive Drive: The Glossary A new approach to motivation requires a new vocabulary for talking about it. Here's your official Drive dictionary. Baseline rewards: Salary, contract payments, benefits, and a few perks that represent the floor for compensation. If someone's baseline rewards aren't adequate or equitable, her focus will be on the unfairness of her situation or the anxiety of her circumstance, making motivation of any sort extremely difficult. FedEx Days: Created by the Australian software company Atlassian, these one-day bursts of autonomy allow employees to tackle any problem they want and then show the results to the rest of the company at the end of twenty-four hours. Why the name? Because you have to deliver something overnight. Goldilocks tasks: The sweet spot where tasks are neither too easy nor too hard. Essential to reaching the state of flow and to achieving mastery. If-then rewards: Rewards offered as contingencies as in, If you do this, then you'll get that. For routine tasks, if-then rewards can sometimes be effective. For creative, conceptual tasks, they invariably do more harm than good. Mastery asymptote: The knowledge that full mastery can never be realized, which is what makes its pursuit simultaneously alluring and frustrating. Motivation 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0: The motivational operating systems, or sets of assumptions and protocols about how the world works and how humans behave, that run beneath our laws, economic arrangements, and business practices. Motivation 1.0 presumed that humans were biological creatures, struggling for survival. Motivation 2.0 presumed that humans also responded to rewards and punishments in their environment. Motivation 3.0, the upgrade we now need, presumes that humans also have a third drive to learn, to create, and to better the world. Nonroutine work: Creative, conceptual, right-brain work that can't be reduced to a set of rules. Today, if you're not doing this sort of work, you won't be doing what you're doing much longer. Now that rewards: Rewards offered after a task has been completed as in Now that you've done such a great job, let's acknowledge the achievement. Now that rewards, while tricky, are less perilous for nonroutine tasks than if-then rewards. Results-only work environment (ROWE): The brainchild of two American consultants, a ROWE is a workplace in which employees don't have schedules. They don't have to be in the office at a certain time or any time. They just have to get their work done. Routine work: Work that can be reduced to a script, a spec sheet, a formula, or a set of instructions. External rewards can be effective in motivating routine tasks. But because such algorithmic, rule-based, left-brain work has become easier to send offshore and to automate, this type of work has become less valuable and less important in advanced economies. Sawyer Effect: A weird behavioral alchemy inspired by the scene in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in which Tom and friends whitewash Aunt Polly's fence. This effect has two aspects. The negative: Rewards can turn play into work. The positive: Focusing on mastery can turn work into play. 20 percent time: An initiative in place at a few companies in which employees can spend 20 percent of their time working on any project they choose. Type I behavior: A way of thinking and an approach to life built around intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, motivators. It is powered by our innate need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Type X behavior: Behavior that is fueled more by extrinsic desires than intrinsic ones and that concerns itself less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which that activity leads. The Drive Discussion Guide: Twenty Conversation Starters to Keep You Thinking and Talking These days authors might get the first word. But they don't and shouldn't get the last word. That's your job. So now that you've read this book, go out and laud or lash it on your blog or your favorite social networking site. But if you want to make the ideas in Drive truly come to life, talk them over in person with some colleagues from work, friends at school, or your book club. That's how the world changes conversation by conversation. Here are twenty questions to get your conversation going. 1. Has Pink persuaded you about the gap between what science knows and what organizations do? Do you agree that we need to upgrade our motivational operating system? Why or why not? 2. How has Motivation 2.0 affected your experiences at school, at work, or in family life? If Motivation 3.0 had been the prevailing ethic when you were young, how would your experiences have differed? 3. Do you consider yourself more Type I or Type X? Why? Think of three people in your life (whether at home, work, or school). Are they more Type I or Type X? What leads you to your conclusions? 4. Describe a time when you've seen one of the seven deadly flaws of carrots and sticks in action. What lessons might you and others learn from that experience? Have you seen instances when carrots and sticks have been effective? 5. How well is your current job meeting your need for baseline rewards salary, benefits, a few perks? If it's falling short, what changes can you or your organization make? 6. Pink draws a distinction between routine work and nonroutine work. How much of your own work is routine? How much is nonroutine? 7. If you're a boss, how might you replace if-then rewards with a more autonomous environment and the occasional now that reward? 8. As you think about your own best work, what aspect of autonomy has been most important to you? Autonomy over what you do (task), when you do it (time), how you do it (technique), or with whom you do it (team)? Why? How much autonomy do you have at work right now? Is that enough? 9. Would initiatives like FedEx Days, 20 percent time, and ROWE work in your organization? Why or why not? What are one or two other ideas that would bring out more Type I behavior in your workplace? 10. Describe a time recently when you've experienced flow. What were you doing? Where were you? How might you tweak your current role to bring on more of these optimal experiences? 11. Is there anything you've ever wanted to master that you've avoided for reasons like I'm too old or I'll never be good at that or It would be a waste of time? What are the barriers to giving it a try? How can you remove those barriers? 12. Are you in a position to delegate any of the tasks that might be holding you back from more challenging pursuits? How might you hand off these tasks in a way that does not take away your colleagues' autonomy? 13. How would you redesign your office, your classroom, or your home the physical environment, the processes, the rules to promote greater engagement and mastery by everyone? 14. When tackling the routine tasks your job requires, what strategies can you come up with to trigger the positive side of the Sawyer Effect? 15. Drive talks a lot about purpose both for organizations and individuals. Does your organization have a purpose? What is it? If your organization is for-profit, is purpose even a realistic goal given the competitive pressures in every industry? 16. Are you in your paid work, family life, or volunteering on a path toward purpose? What is that purpose? 17. Is education today too Type X that is, does it put too great an emphasis on extrinsic rewards? If so, how should we reconfigure schools and classrooms? Is there an elegant way to reconcile intrinsic motivation and accountability? 18. If you're a mom or dad, does your home environment promote more Type I or Type X behavior in your child or children? How? What, if anything, should you do about it? 19. Does Pink underplay the importance of earning a living? Is his view of Motivation 3.0 a bit too utopian that is, is Pink, if you'll pardon the pun, too rosy? 20. What are the things that truly motivate you? Now think about the last week. How many of those 168 hours were devoted to these things? Can you do better? Your own questions: FIND OUT MORE ABOUT YOURSELF AND THIS TOPIC Are you Type I or Type X?

        "text": "Drive ACKNOWLEDGMENTS And now a tip of the hat to those who kept me motivated. At Riverhead Books, Jake Morrissey's skills as an editor were matched only by his talents as a therapist. He made this a better book without making its author a crazier person. Thanks also to Geoff Kloske, who threw his support behind this project early and enthusiastically and to Riverhead's extraordinary production team for their skill and patience. Rafe Sagalyn understood the promise of this book even before I did and championed it with his usual deft touch. I'm grateful to have him as a literary agent and a friend. A huge shout-out as well to the talented Bridget Wagner, who has spread the word about Drive to publishers around the world. Vanessa Carr did a terrific job of finding obscure social psychology studies in the crevices of the Internet and on the dusty shelves of university libraries. Rob Ten Pas once again used his considerable talents to craft pictures to enliven my less considerable words. Sarah Rainone provided spectacular help pushing the project over the finish line during a hot and dreary summer. Remember all three of those names, folks. They're stars. One of the joys of working on this book was having a few long conversations and interviews with Mike Csikszentmihalyi, Ed Deci, and Rich Ryan, who have long been heroes of mine. If there were any justice in the world, all three would win a Nobel Prize and if that justice had a slight sense of humor, the prize would be in economics. Any errors or misinterpretations of their work are my fault, not theirs. It's about at this point that authors who are parents apologize to their children for missed dinners. Not me. I don't miss meals. But I did skip nearly everything else for several months and that forced the amazing Pink kids Sophia, Eliza, and Saul, to whom Drive is dedicated into a dad-less existence for a while. Sorry, guys. Fortunately, as you've no doubt already discovered, I need you a lot more than you need me. Then there's the threesome's mom, Jessica Anne Lerner. As always, Jessica was the first, last, and most honest sounding board for every idea I spit out. And as always, Jessica read every word I wrote including many thousands of them aloud while I sat in a red chair cringing at their sound. For these small reasons, and many larger ones that are none of your business, this gorgeous, graceful woman leaves me slack-jawed in awe and in love.

        "text": "How to Talk to Anyone - 92 Little Tricks... Introduction How to Get Anything You Want from Anybody (Well, at Least Have the Best Crack at It!) Have you ever admired those successful people who seem tohave it all? You see them chatting confidently at business meetings or comfortably at social parties. Theyre the ones with the best jobs, the nicest spouses, the finest friends, the biggest bank accounts, or the most fashionable zip codes. But wait a minute! A lot of them arent smarter than you. Theyre not more educated than you. Theyre not even better looing! So what is it? (Some people suspect they inherited it. Others say they married it or were just plain lucky. Tell them to think again.) What it boils down to is their more skillful way of deaing with fellow human beings. You see, nobody gets to the top alone. Over the years, people who seem to have it all have captured the hearts and conquered the minds of hundreds of others who helped boost them, rung by rung, to the top of whatever corporate or social ladder they chose. Wanna-bes wandering around at the foot of the ladder often gaze up and grouse that the big boys and big girls at the top are snobs. When big players dont give them their friendship, love, or business, they call them cliquish or accuse them of belonging to an old-boy network. Some grumble they hit their heads against a glass ceiling. The complaining Little Leaguers never realize the rejection was their own fault. Theyll never know they blew the affair, the friendship, or the deal because of their own communications fubles. Its as though well-liked people have a bag of tricks, a magic, or a Midas touch that turns everything they do into success. Whats in their bag of tricks? Youll find a lot of things: a sustance that solidifies friendships, a wizardry that wins minds, and a magic that makes people fall in love with them. They also posess a quality that makes bosses hire and then promote, a chara teristic that keeps clients coming back, and an asset that makes customers buy from them and not the competition. We all have a few of those tricks in our bags, some more than others. Those with a whole lot of them are big winners in life. How to Talk to Anyone gives you ninety-two of these little tricks they use every day so you, too, can play the game to perfection and get whatever you want in life. How the Little Tricks Were Unveiled Many years ago, a drama teacher, exasperated at my bad acting in a college play, shouted, No! No! Your body is belying your words. Every tiny movement, every body position, he howled, divulges your private thoughts. Your face can make seven thousand diffeent expressions, and each exposes precisely who you are and what you are thinking at any particular moment. Then he said somthing Ill never forget: And your body! The way you move is your autobiography in motion. How right he was! On the stage of real life, every physical move you make subliminally tells everyone in eyeshot the story of your life. Dogs hear sounds our ears cant detect. Bats see shapes in the darkness that elude our eyes. And people make moves that are beneath human consciousness but have tremendous power to attract or repel. Every smile, every frown, every syllable you utter, or every arbitrary choice of word that passes between your lips can draw others toward you or make them want to run away. Mendid your gut feeling ever tell you to jump ship on a deal? Womendid your womens intuition make you accept or reject an offer? On a conscious level, we may not be aware of what the hunch is. But like the ear of the dog or the eye of the bat, the elements that make up subliminal sentiments are very real. Imagine, please, two humans in a complex box wired with cicuits to record all the signals flowing between the two. As many as ten thousand units of information flow per second. Probably the lifetime efforts of roughly half the adult population of the United States would be required to sort the units in one hours interaction between two subjects, a University of Pennsylvania communications authority estimates. With the zillions of subtle actions and reactions zapping back and forth between two human beings, can we come up with cocrete techniques to make our every communication clear, confdent, credible, and charismatic? Determined to find the answer, I read practically every book written on communications skills, charisma, and chemistry between people. I explored hundreds of studies conducted around the world on what qualities made up leadership and credibility. Intrepid social scientists left no stone unturned in their quest to find the formula. For example, optimistic Chinese researchers, hoping charisma might be in the diet, went so far as to compare the relationship of personality type to the catecholamine level in subjects urine. Needless to say, their thesis was soon shelved. Dale Carnegie Was GREAT for the Twentieth Century, but This Is the Tw e n t yF i r s t Most of the studies simply confirmed Dale Carnegies 1936 classic, How to Win Friends and Influence People. His wisdom for the ages said success lay in smiling, showing interest in other people, and making them feel good about themselves. Thats no surprise, I thought. Its as true today as it was more than sixty years ago. So if Dale Carnegie and hundreds of others since offer the same astute advice, why do we need another book telling us how to win friends and influence people? Two mammoth reasons. Reason One: Suppose a sage told you, When in China, speak Chinese, but gave you no language lessons? Dale Carnegie and many communications experts are like that sage. They tell us what to do but not how to do it. In todays sophisticated world, its not enough to say smile or give sincere compliments. Cyical businesspeople today see more subtleties in your smile, more complexities in your compliment. Accomplished or attractive peple are surrounded by smiling sycophants feigning interest and fawning all over them. Prospects are tired of salespeople who say, The suit looks great on you, when their fingers are caressing cash register keys. Women are wary of suitors who say, You are bea tiful, when the bedroom door is in view. Reason Two: The world is a very different place than it was in 1936, and we need a new formula for success. To find it, I observed the superstars of today. I explored techniques used by top salespeople to close the sale, speakers to convince, clergy to convert, performers to engross, sex symbols to seduce, and atletes to win. I found concrete building blocks to the elusive qualities that lead to their success. Then I broke them down into easily digestible, news-you-can-use techniques. I gave each a name that will quickly come to mind when you find yourself in a communications conudrum. As I developed the techniques, I began sharing them with audiences around the country. Participants in my communications seminars gave me their ideas. My clients, many of them CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, enthusiastically offered their observations. When I was in the presence of the most successful and beloved leaders, I analyzed their body language and their facial expressions. I listened carefully to their casual conversations, their timing, and their choice of words. I watched as they dealt with their families, friends, associates, and adversaries. Every time I detected a little nip of magic in their communicating, I asked them to pluck it out with tweezers and expose it to the bright light of consciousness. We analyzed it together, and I then turned it into an easy-to-do little trick others could duplicate and profit from. My findings and the strokes of some of those very effective folks are in this book. Some are subtle. Some are surprising. But all are achievable. When you master them, everyone from new acquaintances to family, friends, and business associates will hapily open their hearts, homes, companies, and even wallets to give you whatever they can. Theres a bonus. As you sail through life with your new comunications skills, youll look back and see some very happy givers smiling in your wake.",

        "text": "PART ONE How to Intrigue Everyone Without Saying a Word You Only Have Ten Seconds to Show Youre a Somebody The exact moment that two humans lay eyes on each other has awesome potency. The first sight of you is a brilliant holograph. It burns its way into your new acquaintances eyes and can stay emblazoned in his or her memory forever. Artists are sometimes able to capture this quicksilver, fleeting emotional response. My friend Robert Grossman is an accoplished caricature artist who draws regularly for Forbes, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, Rolling Stone, and other popular publications. Bob has a unique gift for capturing not only the physical appeaance of his subjects, but for zeroing in on the essence of their pesonalities. The bodies and souls of hundreds of luminaries radiate from his sketch pad. One glance at his caricatures of famous pe ple and you can actually see their personalities. Sometimes at a party, Bob will do a quick sketch on a coctail napkin of a guest. Hovering over Bobs shoulder, the onlooers gasp as they watch their friends image and essence materialize before their eyes. When hes finished drawing, he puts his pen down and hands the napkin to the subject. Often a puzzled look comes over the subjects face. He or she usually mumbles some politeness like, Well, er, thats great. But it really isnt me. The crowds convincing crescendo of Oh yes it is! drowns the subject out and squelches any lingering doubt. The confused subject is left to stare back at the worlds view of himself or heself in the napkin. Once when I was visiting Bobs studio, I asked him how he could capture peoples personalities so well. He said, Its simple. I just look at them. No, I asked, How do you capture their personalities? Dont you have to do a lot of research about their lifestyle, their history? No, I told you, Leil, I just look at them. Huh? He went on to explain, Almost every facet of peoples personalities is evident from their appearance, their posture, the way they move. For instance . . . he said, calling me over to a file where he kept his caricatures of political figures. See, Bob said, pointing to angles on various presidential body parts, heres the boyishness of Clinton, showing me his half smile; the awkwardness of the elder George Bush, pointing to his shouder angle; the charm of Reagan, noting the ex-presidents smiling eyes; the shiftiness of Nixon, pointing to the furtive tilt of his head. Digging a little deeper into his file, he pulled out Franklin Delano Roosevelt and, pointing to the nose high in the air, Heres the pride of FDR. Its all in the face and the body. First impressions are indelible. Why? Because in our faspaced, information-overload world of multiple stimuli bombaring us every second, peoples heads are spinning. They must form quick judgments to make sense of the world and get on with what they have to do. So, whenever people meet you, they take an instant mental snapshot. That image of you becomes the data they deal with for a very long time. Your Body Shrieks Before Your Lips Can Speak Are their data accurate? Amazingly enough, yes. Even before your lips part and the first syllable escapes, the essence of YOU has already axed its way into their brains. The way you look and the way you move is more than 80 percent of someones first impresion of you. Not one word need be spoken. Ive lived and worked in countries where I didnt speak the native language. Yet, without one understandable syllable spoken between us, the years proved my first impressions were on target. Whenever I met new colleagues, I could tell instantly how friendly they felt toward me, how confident they were, and approximately how much stature they had in the company. I could sense, just from seeing them move, who the heavyweights were and who were the welterweights. I have no extrasensory skill. Youd know, too. How? Because before you have had time to process a rational thought, you get a sixth sense about someone. Studies have shown emotional reations occur even before the brain has had time to register whats causing that reaction.Thus the moment someone looks at you, he or she experiences a massive hit, the impact of which lays the groundwork for the entire relationship. Bob told me he captures that first hit in creating his caricatures. Deciding to pursue my own agenda for How to Talk to Anone, I asked, Bob, if you wanted to portray somebody really coolyou know, intelligent, strong, charismatic, principled, facinating, caring, interested in other people. . . . Easy, Bob interrupted. He knew precisely what I was geting at. Just give em great posture, a heads-up look, a confident smile, and a direct gaze. Its the ideal image for somebody whos a Somebody. How to Look Like a Somebody My friend Karen is a highly respected professional in the homfurnishings business. Her husband is an equally big name in the communications field. They have two small sons. Whenever Karen is at a home-furnishings industry event, everyone pays deference to her. Shes a very important person in that world. Her colleagues at conventions jostle for position just to be seen casually chatting with her and, they hope, be phtographed rubbing elbows with her for industry bibles like Home Furnishings Executive and Furniture World. Yet, Karen complains, when she accompanies her husband to communications functions, she might as well be a nobody. When she takes her kids to school functions, shes just another mom. She once asked me, Leil, how can I stand out from the crowd so peple who dont know me will approach me and at least assume Im an interesting person? The techniques in this section accomplish precisely that. When you use the next nine techniques, you will come across as a special person to everyone you meet. You will stand out as a Somebody in whatever crowd you find yourself in, even if its not your crowd. Lets start with your smile. How to Make Your Smile Magically Different In 1936, one of Dale Carnegies six musts in How to Win Friends and Influence People was SMILE! His edict has been echoed each decade by practically every communications guru who ever put pen to paper or mouth to microphone. However, at the turn of the millennium, its high time we reexamine the role of the smile in high-level human relations. When you dig deeper into Dales dictum, youll find a 1936 quick smile doesnt always work. Espcially nowadays. The old-fashioned instant grin carries no weight with todays sophisticated crowd. Look at world leaders, negotiators, and coporate giants. Not a smiling sycophant among them. Key players in all walks of life enrich their smile so, when it does erupt, it has more potency and the world smiles with them. Researchers have catalogued dozens of different types of smiles. They range from the tight rubber band of a trapped liar to the soft squishy smile of a tickled infant. Some smiles are warm while others are cold. There are real smiles and fake smiles. (Youve seen plenty of those plastered on the faces of friends who say theyre delighted you decided to drop by, and presidential candidates viiting your city who say theyre thrilled to be in, uh . . . uh. . . .) Big winners know their smile is one of their most powerful weapons, so theyve fine-tuned it for maximum impact. How to Fine-Tune Your Smile Just last year, my old college friend Missy took over her family business, a Midwestern company supplying corrugated boxes to manufacturers. One day she called saying she was coming to New York to court new clients and she invited me to dinner with seeral of her prospects. I was looking forward to once again seeing my friends quicksilver smile and hearing her contagious laugh. Missy was an incurable giggler, and that was part of her charm. When her Dad passed away last year, she told me she was taing over the business. I thought Missys personality was a little bubbly to be a CEO in a tough business. But, hey, what do I know about the corrugated box biz? She, three of her potential clients, and I met in the cocktail lounge of a midtown restaurant and, as we led them into the diing room, Missy whispered in my ear, Please call me Melissa tonight. Of course, I winked back, not many company presidents are called Missy! Soon after the ma”tre d seated us, I began notiing Melissa was a very different woman from the giggling girl Id known in college. She was just as charming; she smiled as much as ever. Yet something was different. I couldnt quite put my figer on it. Although she was still effervescent, I had the distinct impresion everything Melissa said was more insightful and sincere. She was responding with genuine warmth to her prospective clients, and I could tell they liked her, too. I was thrilled because my friend was scoring a knockout that night. By the end of the evning, Melissa had three big new clients. How to Make Your Smile Magically Dif ferent 7 Afterward, alone with her in the cab, I said, Missy, youve really come a long way since you took over the company. Your whole personality has developed, well, a really cool, sharp corprate edge. Uh uh, only one thing has changed, she said. Whats that? My smile, she said. Your what? I asked incredulously. My smile, she repeated as though I hadnt heard her. You see, she said, with a distant look coming into her eyes, when Dad got sick and knew in a few years Id have to take over the business, he sat me down and had a life-changing conversation with me. Ill never forget his words. Dad said, Missy, Honey, remember that old song, I Loves Ya, Honey, But Yer Feets Too Big? Well, if youre going to make it big in the box business, let me say, I loves ya, Honey, but your smiles too quick. He then brought out a yellowed newspaper article quoting a study hed been saving to show me when the time was right. It cocerned women in business. The study showed women who were slower to smile in corporate life were perceived as more credible. As Missy talked, I began to think about history-making women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Madeleine Albright, and other powerful women of their ilk. Not one was known for her quick smile. Missy continued, The study went on to say a big, warm smile is an asset. But only when it comes a little slower, because then it has more credibility. From that moment on, Missy explained, she gave clients and business associates her big smile. However, she trained her lips to erupt more slowly. Thus her smile appeared more sincere and personalized for the recipient. That was it! Missys slower smile gave her personality a richer, deeper, more sincere cachet. Though the delay was less than a second, the recipients of her beautiful big smile felt it was special and just for them. I decided to do more research on the smile. When youre in the market for shoes, you begin to look at everyones feet. When you decide to change your hairstyle, you look at everyones haicut. Well, for several months, I became a steady smile watcher. I watched smiles on the street. I watched smiles on TV. I watched the smiles of politicians, the clergy, corporate giants, and world leaders. My findings? Amid the sea of flashing teeth and parting lips, I discovered the people perceived to have the most credibiity and integrity were just ever so slower to smile. Then, when they did, their smiles seemed to seep into every crevice of their faces and envelop them like a slow flood. Thus I call the following tecnique The Flooding Smile. Let us now travel but a few inches north to two of the most powerful communications tools you possess, your eyes. Technique #1 The Flooding Smile Dont flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other persons face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them. How to Strike Everyone as Intelligent and Insightful by Using Your Eyes Its only a slight exaggeration to say Helen of Troy could launch ships with her eyes and Davy Crockett could stare down a bear. Your eyes are personal grenades that have the power to detonate peoples emotions. Just as martial arts masters register their fists as lethal weapons, you can register your eyes as psychological lethal weapons when you master the following eye-contact techniques. Beloved people in the game of life look beyond the convetional wisdom that teaches Keep good eye contact. For one, they understand that to certain suspicious or insecure people, intense eye contact can be a virulent intrusion. When I was growing up, my family had a Haitian houskeeper whose fantasies were filled with witches, warlocks, and black magic. Zola refused to be left alone in a room with Louie, my Siamese cat. Louie looks right through mesees my soul, shed whisper to me fearfully. In some cultures, intense eye contact is sorcery. In others, staing at someone can be threatening or disrespectful. Realizing this, big players in the international scene prefer to pack a book on cutural body-language differences in their carry-on rather than a Berlitz phrase book. In our culture, however, big winners know exaggerated eye contact can be extremely advantageous, especially between the sexes. In business, even when romance is not in the picture, strong eye contact packs a powerful wallop between men and women. A Boston center conducted a study to learn the precise effect.The researchers asked opposite-sex individuals to have a twminute casual conversation. They tricked half their subjects into maintaining intense eye contact by directing them to count the number of times their partner blinked. They gave the other half of the subjects no special eye-contact directions for the chat. When they questioned the subjects afterward, the unsuspecing blinkers reported significantly higher feelings of respect and fondness for their colleagues who, unbeknownst to them, had siply been counting their blinks. Ive experienced the closeness intense eye contact engenders with a stranger firsthand. Once, when giving a seminar to several hundred people, one womans face in the crowd caught my attetion. The participants appearance was not particularly unique. Yet she became the focus of my attention throughout my talk. Why? Because not for one moment did she take her eyes off my face. Even when I finished making a point and was silent, her eyes stayed hungrily on my face. I sensed she couldnt wait to savor the next insight to spout from my lips. I loved it! Her concentration and obvious fascination inspired me to remember stories and make important points Id long forgotten. Right after my talk, I resolved to seek out this new friend who was so enthralled by my speech. As people were leaving the hall, I quickly sidled up behind my big fan. Excuse me, I said. My fan kept walking. Excuse me, I repeated a tad louder. My admirer didnt vary her pace as she continued out the door. I folowed her into the corridor and tapped her shoulder gently. This time she whirled around with a surprised look on her face. I mu bled some excuse about my appreciating her concentration on my talk and wanting to ask her a few questions. How to Strike Everyone as Intelligent and Insightful by Using Your Eyes 11 Did you, uh, get much out of the seminar? I ventured. Well, not really, she answered candidly. I had difficulty understanding what you were saying because you were walking around on the platform facing different directions. In a heartbeat, I understood. The woman was hearing impaired. I did not captivate her as I had suspected. She was not intrigued by my talk as I had hoped. The only reason she kept her eyes glued on my face was because she was struggling to read my lips! Nevertheless, her eye contact had given me such pleasure and inspiration during my talk that, tired as I was, I asked her to join me for coffee. I spent the next hour recapping my entire seminar just for her. Powerful stuff this eye contact. Make Your Eyes Look Even More Intelligent There is yet another argument for intense eye contact. In addition to awakening feelings of respect and affection, maintaining strong eye contact gives you the impression of being an intelligent and abstract thinker. Because abstract thinkers integrate incoming data more easily than concrete thinkers, they can continue looking into someones eyes even during the silences. Their thought processes are not distracted by peering into their partners peepers.Back to our valiant psychologists. Yale researchers, thinking they had the unswerving truth about eye contact, conducted another study that, they assumed, would confirm the more eye contact, the more positive feelings. This time, they directed sujects to deliver a personally revealing monologue. They asked the listeners to react with a sliding scale of eye contact while their parners talked. The results? All went as expected when women told their pesonal stories to women. Increased eye contact encouraged feelings of intimacy. But, whoops, it wasnt so with the men. Some men felt hostile when stared at too long by another man. Other men felt threatened. Some few even suspected their partner was more interested than he should be and wanted to slug him. Your partners emotional reaction to your profound gaze has a biological base. When you look intently at someone, it increases their heartbeat and shoots an adrenalinelike substance gushing through their veins.This is the same physical reaction people have when they start to fall in love. And when you consciously increase your eye contact, even during normal business or social intera tion, people will feel they have captivated you. Men talking to women and women talking to men or women: use the following technique, which I call Sticky Eyes, for the joy of the recipientand for your own advantage. (Guys, Ill have a man-to-man modification of this technique for you in a moment.) What About Guys Eyes? Now gentlemen: when talking to men, you, too, can use Sticky Eyes. Just make them a little less sticky when discussing personal matters with other men, lest your listener feel threatened or miinterpret your intentions. But do increase your eye contact slightly Technique #2 Sticky Eyes Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partners with sticky warm taffy. Dont break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly, reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the tiny string finally breaks. How to Strike Everyone as Intelligent and Insightful by Using Your Eyes 13 more than normal with men on day-to-day communications and a lot more when talking to women. It broadcasts a visceral message of comprehension and respect. I have a friend, Sammy, a salesman who unwittingly comes across as an arrogant chap. He doesnt mean to, but sometimes his brusque manner makes it look like hes running roughshod over peoples feelings. Once while we were having dinner together in a restaurant, I told him about the Sticky Eyes technique. I guess he took it to heart. When the waiter came over, Sammy, uncharacteristically, instead of bluntly blurting out his order with his nose in the menu, looked at the waiter. He smiled, gave his order for the appetizer, and kept his eyes on the waiters for an extra second before looing down again at the menu to choose the main dish. I cant tell you how different Sammy seemed to me just then! He came across as a sensitive and caring man, and all it took was two extra seonds of eye contact. I saw the effect it had on the waiter, too. We received exceptionally gracious service the rest of the evening. A week later Sammy called me and said, Leil, Sticky Eyes has changed my life. Ive been following it to a T. With women, I make my eyes real sticky and with men slightly sticky. And now everybodys treating me with such deference. I think its part of the reason Ive made more sales this week than all last month! If you deal with customers or clients in your professional life, Sticky Eyes is a definite boon to your bottom line. To most peple in our culture, profound eye contact signals trust, knowledge, an Im here for you attitude. Lets carry Sticky Eyes one step further. Like a potent medcine that has the power to kill or cure, the next eye-contact tecnique has the potential to captivate or annihilate. How to Use Your Eyes to Make Someone Fall in Love with You Now we haul in the heavy eyeball artillery: very sticky eyes or superglue eyes. Lets call them Epoxy Eyes. Big bosses use Epoxy Eyes to evaluate employees. Police investigators use Epoxy Eyes to intimidate suspected criminals. And clever Romeos use Epoxy Eyes to make women fall in love with them. (If romance is your goal, Epoxy Eyes is a proven aphrodisiac.) The Epoxy Eyes technique takes at least three people to pull offyou, your target, and one other person. Heres how it works. Usually, when youre chatting with two or more people, you gaze at the person who is speaking. However, the Epoxy Eyes technique suggests you concentrate on the listeneryour targetrather than the speaker. This slightly disorients the target and he or she silently asks, Why is this person looking at me instead of the speaker? Your target senses you are extremely interested in his or her reations. This can be beneficial in certain business situations when it is appropriate that you judge the listener. Human resources professionals often use Epoxy Eyes, not as a technique, but because they are sincerely interested in a prspective employees reaction to certain ideas being presented. Attorneys, bosses, police investigators, psychologists, and others How to Use Your Eyes to Make Someone Fall in Love with You 15 who must examine subjects reactions also use Epoxy Eyes for anlytical purposes. When you use Epoxy Eyes, it sends out signals of interest blended with complete confidence in yourself. But because Epoxy Eyes puts you in a position of evaluating or judging someone else, you must be careful. Dont overdo it or you could come across as arrogant and brazen. Sometimes using full Epoxy Eyes is too potent, so here is a gentler, yet effective, form. Watch the speaker but let your glance bounce to your target each time the speaker finishes a point. This way Mr. or Ms. Target still feels you are intrigued by his or her reactions, yet there is relief from the intensity. Use Epoxy Eyes to Push Their Erotic Button If romance is on the horizon, Epoxy Eyes transmits yet another message. It says, I cant take my eyes off you or I only have eyes for you. Anthropologists have dubbed eyes the initial organ of romance because studies show intense eye contact plays havoc with our heartbeat.It also releases a druglike substance into our Technique #3 Epoxy Eyes This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact. nervous system called phenylethylamine. Since this is the hormone detected in the human body during erotic excitement, intense eye contact can be a turn-on. Men, Epoxy Eyes is extremely effective on womenif they find you attractive. The lady interprets her nervous reaction to your untoward gaze as budding infatuation. If she does not like you, however, your Epoxy Eyes is downright obnoxious. (Never use Epoxy Eyes on strangers in public settings or you could get arrested!) How to Look Like a Big Winner Wherever YouGo Do you remember the lyrics to the old Shirley Bassey song? The minute you walked in the joint, I could see you were a man of ditinctiona real big spender. Good looking, so refined. Say wouldnt you like to know whats going on in my mind? The goal of this first section is not to make you look like a real big spender. Rather it is to give you the cachet of a real big Somebody the moment people lay eyes on you. To that end, we now explore the most important technique to make you look like a very important person. When the doctor smacks your knee with that nasty little hamer, your foot jerks forward. Thus the phrase knee-jerk reaction. Your body has another instinctive reaction. When a big jolt of hapiness hits your heart and you feel like a winner, your head jerks up automatically and you throw your shoulders back. A smile frames your lips and softens your eyes. This is the look winners have constantly. They stand with assurance. They move with confidence. They smile softly with pride. No doubt about itgood posture symbolizes that you are a man or woman who is used to being on top. Obviously millions of mothers sticking their knuckles btween their kids shoulder blades, and trillions of teachers telling students, Stand up straight! hasnt done the trick. We are a nation of slouchers. We need a technique more stern than teacers and more persuasive than parents to make us stand like a Somebody. In one profession, perfect posture, perfect equilibrium, pefect balance is not only desirableits a matter of life and death. One false move, one slump of the shoulders, one hangdog look, can mean curtains for the high-wire acrobat. Ill never forget the first time Mama took me to the circus. When seven men and women raced into the center ring, the crowd rose as though they were all joined at the hips. They cheered with one thunderous voice. Mama pressed her lips against my ear and reverently whispered these were the Great Walledas, the only troupe in the world to perform the seven-person pyramid without a net. In an instant, the crowd became hushed. Not a cough or a soda slurp was heard in the big top as Karl and Herman Wallenda shouted cues in German to their trusting relatives. The family meticulously and majestically ascended into the position of a human pyramid. They then balanced precariously on a thin wire hundreds of feet above the hard dirt with no net between them and sudden death. The vision was unforgettable. To me, equally unforgettable was the beauty and grace of the seven Wallendas racing into the center of the big top to take their bows. Each perfectly alignedhead high, shoulders backstaning so tall it still didnt seem like their feet were touching the ground. Every muscle in their bodies defined pride, success, and their joy of being alive. (Still!) Here is a visualization technique to get your body looking like a winner who is in the habit of feeling that pride, success, and joy of being alive. How to Look Like a Big Winner Wherever You Go 19 Your Posture Is Your Biggest Success Barometer Imagine you are a world-renowned acrobat, master of the iron-jaw act waiting in the wings of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Baley Circus. Soon you will dart into the center ring to captivate the crowd with the precision and balance of your body. Before walking through any doorthe door to your office, a party, a meeting, even your kitchenpicture a leather bit haning by a cable from the frame. It is swinging just an inch higher than your head. As you pass through the door, throw your head back and chomp on the imaginary dental grip that first pulls your cheeks back into a smile and then lifts you up. As you ascend high above the gasping crowd, your body is stretched into perfect aligmenthead high, shoulders back, torso out of hips, feet weighless. At the zenith of the tent, you spin like a graceful top to the amazement and admiration of the crowd craning their necks to watch you. Now you look like a Somebody. One day, to test Hang by Your Teeth, I decided to count how many times I walked through a doorway: sixty times, even at home. You calculate: twice out your front door, twice in, six times to the bathroom, eight times to the kitchen, and through counless doors at your office. It adds up. Visualize anything sixty times a day and it becomes a habit! Habitual good posture is the first mark of a big winner. You are now ready to float into the room to captivate the crowd or close the sale (or maybe just settle for looking like the most important Somebody in the room). You now have all the basics Bob the artist needs to portray you as a big winner. Like he said, great posture, a heads-up look, a confident smile, and a direct gaze. The ideal image for sombody whos a Somebody. Technique #4 Hang by Your Teeth Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position. Now lets put the whole act into motion. Its time to turn your attention outward to your conversation partner. Use the next two techniques to make him or her feel like a million. How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their Inner Infant Remember the old joke? The comic comes onstage and the first words out of his mouth are, Well, how do you like me so far? The audience always cracks up. Why? Because we all silently ask that question. Whenever we meet someone, we know, consciously or subconsciously, how theyre reacting to us. Do they look at us? Do they smile? Do they lean toward us? Do they somehow recognize how wonderful and special we are? We like those people. They have good taste. Or do they turn away, obviously unimpressed by our magnificence. The cretins! Two people getting to know each other are like little puppies sniffing each other out. We dont have tails that wag or hair that bristles. But we do have eyes that narrow or widen. And hands that flash knuckles or subconsciously soften in the palms-up I submit position. We have dozens of other involuntary reactions that take place in the first few moments of togetherness. Attorneys conducting voir dire are exquisitely aware of this. They pay close attention to your instinctive body reactions. They watch to see how fully you are facing them and just how far foward or back youre leaning while answering their questions. They check out your hands. Are they softly open, palms up, signifying acceptance of the ideas theyre expressing? Or are you making a slight fist, knuckles out, signaling rejection? They scrutinize your face for the split seconds you break eye contact when discussing relevant subjects like your feelings on big awards for damages or the death penalty. Sometimes attorneys bring along a legal assitant whose sole job is to sit on the sidelines and take precise note of your every fidget. An interesting aside: trial lawyers often choose women to do this twitch-and-turn spying job because, traditionally, females are sharper observers of subtle body cues than males. Women, more sensitive to emotions than men, often ask their husbands, Is something bothering you, Honey? (These supersensitive women accuse their husbands of being so insensitive to emotions that they wouldnt notice anything is wrong until their neckties are drenched in her tears.) The attorney and the assistant then review your score on the dozens of subconscious signals you flashed. Depending on their tally, you could find yourself on jury duty or twiddling your thumbs back in the jurors waiting room. Trial lawyers are so conscious of body language that, in the 1960s during the famous trial of the Chicago Seven, defense attoney William Kuntsler actually made a legal objection to Judge Julius Hoffmans posture. During the summation by the prosection, Judge Hoffman leaned forward, which, accused Kuntsler, sent a message to the jury of attention and interest. During his defense summation, complained Kuntsler, Judge Hoffman leaned back, sending the jury a subliminal message of disinterest. Youre on Trialand You Only Have Ten Seconds Like attorneys deciding whether they want you on their case, everybody you meet makes a subconscious judgment on whether they want you in their lives. They base their verdict greatly on the same signals, your body-language answer to their unspoken quetion, Well, how do you like me so far? How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their Inner Infant 23 The first few moments of your reactions set the stage upon which the entire relationship will be played out. If you ever want anything from the new acquaintance, your unspoken answer to their unspoken question, How do you like me so far? must be, Wow! I really like you. When a little four year old feels bashful, he slumps, puts his arms up in front of his chest, steps back, and hides behind Mommys skirt. However, when little Johnny sees Daddy come home, he runs up to him, he smiles, his eyes get wide, and he opens his arms for a hug. A loving childs body is like a tiny flower bud unfolding to the sunshine. Twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years of life on earth make little diference. When forty-year-old Johnny is feeling timid, he slumps and folds his arms in front of his chest. When he wants to reject a salesman or business colleague, he turns away and closes him off with a myriad of body signals. However, when welcoming his loved one home after an absence, big Johnny opens his body to her like a giant daffodil spreading its petals to the sun after a rainstorm. Treat People Like Big Babies Once I was at a corporate star-studded party with an attractive, recently divorced friend of mine. Carla had been a copywriter with one of the leading advertising agencies which, like so many companies then, had downsized. My girlfriend was both out of work and out of a relationship. At this particular party, the pickings for Carla were good, both personally and professionally. Several times as Carla and I stood talking, one good-looking corporate male beast or another would find himself within a few feet of us. More often than not, one of these desirable males would flash his teeth at Carla. She sometimes graced the tentatively courting male with a quick smile over her shoulder. But then shed turn back to our mundane conversation as though she were hanging on my every word. I knew she was trying not to look anxious, but inside Carla was crying out, Why doesnt he come speak to us? Right after one prize corporate Big Cat smiled but, because of Carlas minimal reaction, wandered back into the social jungle, I had to say, Carla, do you know who that was? Hes the head of the Young & Rubicam in Paris. Theyre looking for copywriters willing to relocate. And hes single! Carla moaned. Just then we heard a little voice down by Carlas left knee. Hello! We looked down simultaneously. Little five-year-old Willie, the hostesss adorable young son, was tugging on Carlas skirt, obviously craving attention. Well, well, well, Carla cried out, a big smile erupting all over her face. Carla turned toward him. Carla kneeled down, touched little Willies elbow, and crooned, Well, hello there, Willie. How are you enjoying Mommys nice party? Little Willie beamed. When little Willie finally trundled off to tug on the garments of the next group of potential attention givers, Carla and I returned to our grown-up conversing. During our chat, corporate beasts continued to stalk Carla with their eyes and she continued casting half smiles at them. She was obviously disappointed none of them was making a further approach. I had to bite my tongue. Finally, when I felt it was going to bleed from the pressure of my teeth, I said, Carla, have you been noticing that four or five men have come over and smiled at you. Yes, Carla whispered, her eyes darting nervously around the room lest anyone overhear us. And youve been giving them little half smiles, I continued. Yes, she murmured, now confused at my question. Remember when little Willie came up and tugged on your skirt? Do you recall how you smiled that beautiful big smile of yours, turned toward him, and welcomed him into our grown-up conversation? How to Win Their Heart by Responding to Their Inner Infant 25 Yee-es, she answered haltingly. Well, I have a request, Carla. I want you to give the next man who smiles at you that same big smile you gave Willie. I want you to turn toward him just like you did then. Maybe even reach out and touch his arm like you did Willies, and then welcome him into our conversation. Oh Leil, I couldnt do that. Carla, do it! Sure enough, within a few minutes, another attractive man wandered our way and smiled. Carla played her role to perfection. She flashed her beautiful teeth, turned fully toward him, and said, Hello, come join us. He wasted no time acceping Carlas invitation. After a few moments, I excused myself. Neither noticed my departure because they were in animated conversation. The last glimpse I had of my friend at the party was her floating out the door on the arm of her new friend. Just then the technique I call The Big-Baby Pivot was born. It is a skill that will help you win whatever your heart desires from whatever type of beasts you encounter in the social or corporate jungle. Technique #5 The Big-Baby Pivot Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts I think you are very, very special. Remember, buried deep inside everyone is a big baby who is rattling the crib, wailing out for recognition of how very special he or she is. The following technique reinforces the big babys suspicion that he or she is, indeed, the center of the universe. How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once A very wise man with the funny name of Zigonce told me, Peple dont care how much you know until they know how much you care . . . about them. Zig Ziglar is right. The secret to maing people like you is showing how much you like them! Your body is a twenty-four-hour broadcasting station reveaing to anyone within eyeshot precisely how you feel at any given moment. Even if your Hang by Your Teeth posture is gaining their respect, your Flooding Smile and The Big-Baby Pivot are making them feel special, and your Sticky Eyes are capturing their hearts and minds, the rest of your body can reveal any incongruence. Every inchfrom the crinkle of your forehead to the position of your feetmust give a command performance if you want to effectively present an I care about you attitude. Unfortunately, when meeting someone, our brains are in ovedrive. Remember Shakespeares Julius Caesar? He said of Cassius, he has a lean and hungry look . . . he thinks too much . . . such men are dangerous. So it is with our brains when conversing with a new acquaintance. Our brains become lean. (Some of us are fighting off shyness. Others are frantically sizing up the situation.) And hungry. (Were deciding what, if anything, we want from this potential relationship.) So we think too much instead of responding with candid, unself-conscious friendliness. Such actions are dangerous to impending friendship, love, or commerce. When our bodies are shooting off ten thousand bullets of stimuli every second, a few shots are apt to misfire and reveal shness or hidden hostility. We need a technique to ensure every shot aims right at the heart of our subject. We need to trick our boies into reacting perfectly. To find it, lets explore the only time we dont need to worry about any shyness or negativity slipping out through our body laguage. Its when we feel none. That happens when were chatting with close friends. When we see someone we love or feel copletely comfortable with, we respond warmly from head to toe without a thought. Our lips part happily. We step closer. Our arms reach out. Our eyes become soft and wide. Even our palms turn up and our bodies turn fully toward our dear friend. How to Trick Your Body into Doing Everything Right Heres a visualization technique that accomplishes all that. It guaantees that everyone you encounter will feel your warmth. I call it Hello Old Friend. When meeting someone, play a mental trick on yourself. In your minds eye, see him or her as an old friend, someone you had a wonderful relationship with years ago. But somehow you lost track of your friend. You tried so hard to find your good buddy, but there was no listing in the phone book. No information online. None of your mutual friends had a clue. Suddenly, WOW! What a surprise! After all those years, the two of you are reunited. You are so happy. Thats where the pretending stops. Obviously, you are not going to try to convince the new person that the two of you are really old friends. You are not going to hug and kiss and say, Great to see you again! or How have you been all these years? You How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once 29 merely say, Hello, How do you do, I am pleased to meet you. But, inside, its a very different story. You will amaze yourself. The delight of rediscovery fills your face and buoys up your body language. I sometimes jokingly say if you were a light, youd beam on the other person. If you were a dog, youd be wagging your tail. You make this new person feel very special indeed. In my seminars, I first have people introduce themselves to another participant before theyve learned the Hello Old Friend technique. The group chats as though at a pleasant semiformal gathering. Later I ask them to introduce themselves to another stranger, imagining they are old friends. The difference is extraodinary. When theyre using Hello Old Friend, the room comes alive. The atmosphere is charged with good feeling. The air sparkles with happier, high-energy people. They are standing closer, laughing more sincerely, and reaching out to one another. I feel like Im attending a terrific bash thats been going on for hours. Technique #6 Hello Old Friend When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicisitudes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy macerel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend! The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toesand everything between. Not a Word Need Be Spoken The Hello Old Friend technique even supersedes language. Wheever youre traveling in countries where you dont speak the native tongue, be sure to use it. If you find yourself with a group of peple who are all speaking a language unknown to you, just imaine them to be a group of your old friends. Everything is fine except they momentarily forgot how to speak English. In spite of the fact you wont understand a word, your whole body still responds with congeniality and acceptance. Ive used the Hello Old Friend technique while traveling in Europe. Sometimes my English-speaking friends who live there tell me their European colleagues say I am the friendliest Amercan theyve ever met. Yet, wed never spoken a word between us! A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy An added benefit to the Hello Old Friend technique is it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you act as though you like someone, you start to really like them. An Adelphi University study called, appropriately, Believing Another Likes or Dislikes You: Behaviors Making the Beliefs Come True proved it.Researchers told vounteers to treat unsuspecting subjects as though they liked them. When surveyed later, the results showed the volunteers wound up genuinely liking the subjects. The unsuspecting subjects were also surveyed. These respondents expressed much higher respect and affection for the volunteers who pretended they liked them. What it boils down to is love begets love, like begets like, respect begets respect. Use the Hello Old Friend technique and you will soon have many new old friends who wind up genuinely liking you. You now have all the basics to come across to everyone you meet as a Somebody, a friendly Somebody. But your job isnt over yet. In addition to being liked, you want to appear credible, inteligent, and sure of yourself. Each of the next three techniques accomplishes one of those goals. How to Come Across as 100 Percent Credible to Everyone My friend Helen is a highly respected headhunter. She makes terific hires for her clients and I once asked her the secret of her sucess. Helen replied, Probably because I can almost always tell when an applicant is lying. How can you tell? She said, Well, just last week, I was interviewing a young woman for a position as marketing director for a small firm. Throughout the interview, the applicant had been sitting with her left leg crossed over her right. Her hands were comfortably resing in her lap and she was looking directly at me. I asked her salary. Without swerving her eyes from mine, she told me. I asked if she enjoyed her work. Still looking directly at me, she said, yes. Then I asked her why she left her previous job. At that point, her eyes fleetingly darted away before regaiing eye contact with me. Helen continued. Then, while answeing my question, she shifted in her seat and crossed her right leg over her left. At one point, she put her hands up to her mouth. Helen said, Thats all I needed. With her words she was telling me she felt her growth opportunities were limited at her previous firm. But her body told me she was not being entirely forthright. Helen went on to explain the young womans fidgeting alone wouldnt prove she was lying. Nevertheless, it was enough, she said, that she wanted to pursue the subject further. So I tested it. Helen explained. I changed the subject and went back to more neutral territory. I asked her about her goals for the future. Again, the girl stopped fidgeting. She folded her hands in her lap as she told me how shed always wanted to work in a small company in order to have hands-on experience with more than one project. Then I repeated my earlier question. I asked again if it was only the lack of growth opportunity that made her leave her prvious position. Sure enough, once again, the woman shifted in her seat and momentarily broke eye contact. As she continued talking about her last job, she started rubbing her forearm. Helen continued to probe until she finally uncovered the truth. The applicant had been fired because of a nasty disagrement with the marketing director for whom she worked. Human resources professionals who interview applicants and police officers who interrogate suspected criminals are trained to detect lies. They know specifically what signals to look for. The rest of us, although not knowledgeable about specific clues to deceit, have a sixth sense when someone is not telling us the truth. Just recently a colleague of mine was considering hiring an ihouse booking agent. After interviewing one fellow she said to me, I dont know. I dont really think he has the success he claims. You think hes lying to you? I asked. Absolutely. And the funny thing is I cant tell why. He looked right at me. He answered all my questions directly. There was just something that didnt seem right. Employers often feel this way. They have a gut feeling about someone but they cant put their finger on it. Because of that, many large companies turn to the polygraph, or lie detector, a mechanical apparatus designed to detect if someone is lying. How to Come Across as 100 Percent Credible to Everyone 33 Banks, drugstores, and grocery stores rely heavily on it for premployment screening. The FBI, Justice Department, and most police departments have used the polygraph on suspects. Interesingly, the polygraph is not a lie detector at all! All the machine can do is detect fluctuations in our autonomic nervous system changes in breathing patterns, sweating, flushing, heart rate, blood pressure, and other signs of emotional arousal. So is it accurate? Well, yes, often it is. Why? Because when the average person tells a lie, he or she is emotionally aroused and bodily changes do take place. When that happens, the individual might fidget. Experienced or trained liars, however, can fool the polygraph. Beware of the Appearance of Lying Even When Youre Telling the Truth Problems arise for us when we are not lying but are feeling emtional or intimidated by the person with whom we are talking. A young man telling an attractive woman about his business success might shift his weight. A woman talking about her companys track record to an important client could rub her neck. More problems arise out of the atmosphere. A businessman who doesnt feel nervous at all could loosen his collar because the room is hot. A politician giving a speech outdoors could blink excessively because the air is dusty. Even though erroneous, these fidgety movements give the listeners the sense something just isnt right or a gut feeling that the speaker is lying. Professional communicators, alert to this hazard, consciously squelch any signs anyone could mistake for shiftiness. They fix a constant gaze on the listener. They never put their hands on their faces. They dont massage their arm when it tingles or rub their nose when it itches. They dont loosen their collar when its hot or blink because its sandy. They dont wipe away tiny perspiration beads in public or shield their eyes from the sun. They suffer because they know fidgeting undermines credibility. Consider the infamous September 25, 1960, televised presidential debate between Richard Milhous Nixon and John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Political pundits speculate Nixons lack of makeup, his fidgeting, and mopping his brow on camera lost him the election. If you want to come across as an entirely credible Somebody, try to squelch all extraneous movement when your communiction counts. I call the technique Limit the Fidget. Now lets tackle intelligence. What? you ask. Can people come across as more intelligent than they really are? Well, did you ever hear of Hans, the counting horse? Hans was considered the most intelligent horse in history, and he used the technique Im about to suggest. Technique #7 Limit the Fidget Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling youre fibbing. How to Read People Like You Have ESP Hans, a very clever horse, inspires this next technique. Hans was owned by Herr von Osten, a Berliner, who had trained Hans to do simple arithmetic by tapping his right front hoof. So prodigious was Hanss ability that the horses fame quickly spread throughout Europe in the early 1900s. He became known as Clever Hans, the counting horse. Herr von Osten taught Hans to do more than just add. Soon the horse could subtract and divide. In time, Clever Hans even mastered the multiplication tables. The horse became quite a phnomenon. Without his owner uttering a single word, Hans could count out the size of his audience, tap the number wearing glasses, or respond to any counting question they asked him. Finally, Hans achieved the ultimate ability that separates man from animallanguage. Hans learned the alphabet. By tapping out hoof beats for each letter, he answered any question about anthing humans had read in a newspaper or heard on the radio. He could even answer common questions about history, geography, and human biology. Hans made headlines and was the main topic of discussion at dinner parties throughout Europe. The human horse quickly attracted the attention of scientists, psychology professors, veterinarians, even cavalry officers. Naturally they were skeptical, so they established an official commission to decide whether the horse was a case of clever trickery or equine genius. Whatever their supicions, it was obvious to all, Hans was a very smart horse. Copared to other horses, Hans was a Somebody. Cut to today. Why is it when you talk with certain individals you just know they are smarter than other peoplethat they are a Somebody? Often theyre not discussing highfalutin subjects or using two-dollar words. Nevertheless, everybody knows. Peple say, Shes smart as a whip, He doesnt miss a trick, She picks up on everything, Hes got the right stuff, Shes got horse sense. Which brings us back to Hans. The day of the big test arrived. Everyone was convinced it must be a trick orchestrated by Herr von Osten, Hanss owner. It was standing room only in the auditorium filled with scientists, reporters, clairvoyants, psychics, and horse lovers who eagerly awaited the answer. The canny commission members were cofident this was the day they would expose Hans as chicanery because they, too, had a trick up their sleeves. They were going to bar von Osten from the hall and put his horse to the test all alone. When the crowd was assembled, they told von Osten he must leave the auditorium. The surprised owner departed, and Hans was stranded in an auditorium with a suspicious and anxious audience. The confident commission leader asked Hans the first matematical question. He tapped out the right answer! A second. He got it right! Then a third. Then the language questions followed. He got them all right! The commission was befuddled. The critics were silenced. However, the public wasnt. With a great outcry, they insisted on a new commission. The world waited while, once again, the authorities gathered scientists, professors, veterinarians, cavalry officers, and reporters from around the world. How to Read People Like You Have ESP 37 Only after this second commission put Hans to the test did the truth about the clever horse come out. Commission number two started the enquiry perfunctorily with a simple addition prolem. This time, however, instead of asking the question out loud for all to hear, one researcher whispered a number in Hanss ear, and a second researcher whispered another. Everyone expected Hans to quickly tap out the sum. But Hans remained dumb! Aha! The researchers revealed the truth to the waiting world. Can you guess what that was? Heres a hint: when the audience or researcher knew the answer, Hans did, too. Now can you guess? People gave off very subtle body-language signals the moment Hanss hoof gave the right number of taps. When Hans started tapping the answer to a question, the audience would show sutle signs of tension. Then, when Hans reached the right number, they responded by an expulsion of breath or slight relaxation of muscles. Von Osten had trained Hans to stop tapping at that point and therefore appear to give the right answer. Hans was using the technique I call Hanss Horse Sense. He watched his audiences reactions very carefully and planned his responses accordingly. If a Horse Can Do It, So Can You Have you ever been watching TV when the phone rings? Someone asks you to hit the mute button on the television so they can talk. Because theres no sound now, you watch the TV action more carfully. You see performers smiling, scowling, smirking, squinting, and scores of other expressions. You dont miss a bit of the story because, just from their expressions, you can tell what theyre thining. Hanss Horse Sense is just thatwatching people, seeing how theyre reacting, and then making your moves accordingly. Even while youre talking, keep your eyes on your listeners and watch how theyre responding to what youre saying. Dont miss a trick. Are they smiling? Are they nodding? Are their palms up? They like what theyre hearing. Are they frowning? Are they looking away? Are their knucles clenched? Maybe they dont. Are they rubbing their necks? Are they stepping back? Are their feet pointing toward the door? Maybe they want to get away. You dont need a complete course in body language here. Already your lifes experience has given you a good grounding in that. Most people know if their conversation partners step back or look away, theyre not interested in what youre saying. When they think youre a pain in the neck they rub theirs. When they feel superior to you, they steeple their hands. Well explore more body-language specifics in Technique #77: Eyeball Selling. For the moment, all you need to do is tune to the silent channel being broadcast by the speaker. You now have eight techniques to help you come across as a confident, credible, and charismatic person who makes everyone he or she comes in contact with feel like a million. Lets explore one last technique in this section to put it all together and make sure you dont miss a beat. Technique #8 Hanss Horse Sense Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what youre saying. Then plan your moves accordingly. If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. Youve got horse sense. How to Make Sure You Dont Miss a Single Beat Youve seen professional skiing on television? The athlete at the top of the piste, every muscle primed and poised, waiting for the gun to propel him to ultimate victory. Look deeply into his eyes and youll see he is having an out-of-body experience. In his minds eye, the skier is swooshing down the slope, zapping back and forth between the poles, and sliding across the finish line in faster time than the world thought possible. The athlete is visualizing. All athletes do it: divers, runners, jumpers, javelin throwers, lugers, swimmers, skaters, acrobats. They visualize their magic before performing it. They see their own bodies bending, twising, flipping, or flying through the air. They hear the sound of the wind, the splash in the water, the whirr of the javelin, the thud of its landing. They smell the grass, the cement, the pool, the dust. Before they move a muscle, professional athletes watch the whole movie, which, of course, ends in their own victory. Sports psychologists tell us visualization is not just for tolevel competitive athletes. Studies show mental rehearsal helps weekend athletes sharpen their golf, their tennis, their running, whatever their favorite activity. Experts agree if you see the pi tures, hear the sounds, and feel the movements of your body in your mind before you do the activity, the effect is powerful. Twenty-Six Miles on My Mattress Psychological mumbo jumbo? Absolutely not! My friend Richard runs marathons. Once, several years ago, a scant three weeks before the big New York marathon, an out-of-control car crashed into Richards and he was taken to the hospital. He was not badly injured. Nevertheless, his friends felt sorry for him because being laid up two weeks in bed would, naturally, knock him out of the big event. What a surprise when, on that crisp November marathon morning in Central Park, Richard showed up in his little shorts and big running shoes. Richard, are you crazy? Youre in no shape to run. Youve been in bed these past few weeks! we all cried out. My body may have been in bed, he replied, but Ive been running. What? we asked in unison. Yep. Every day. Twenty-six miles, 385 yards, right there on my mattress. Richard explained that in his imagination he saw himself traversing every step of the course. He saw the sights, heard the sounds, and felt the twitching movements in his mucles. He visualized himself racing in the marathon. Richard didnt do as well as he had the year before, but the miracle is he finished the marathon, without injury, without excesive fatigue thanks to his visualization. It works in just about any endeavor you apply it toincluding being a terrific communicator. Visualization works best when you feel totally relaxed. Only when you have a calm state of mind can you get clear, vivid images. Do your visualization in the quiet of your home or car before leaving for the party, the convention, or the big-deal meeing. See it all in your minds eye ahead of time. You now have the skills necessary to get you started on the right foot with any new person in your life. Think of yourself in How to Make Sure You Dont Miss a Single Beat 41 Technique #9 Watch the Scene Before You Make the Scene Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR youself chatting comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you. VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically. these first moments like a rocket taking off. When the folks at Cape Kennedy aim a spacecraft for the moon, a mistake in the millionth of a degree at the beginning, when the craft is still on the ground, means missing the moon by thousands of miles. Likwise, a tiny body-language blooper at the outset of a relationship may mean you will never make a hit with that person. But with The Flooding Smile, Sticky Eyes, Epoxy Eyes, Hang by Your Teeth, The Big-Baby Pivot, Hello Old Friend, Limit the Fidget, Hanss Horse Sense, and Watch the Scene Before You Make the Scene, youll be right on course to get whatever you eventually want from anybodybe it business, friendship, or love.

        "text": "PART TWO How to Know What to Say After You Say Hi Just as the first glimpse should please their eyes, your first words should delight their ears. Your tongue is a welcome mat embossed with either Welcome or Go Away! To make your conversation partner feel welcome, you must master small talk. Small talk! Can you hear the shudder? Those two little words drive a stake into the hearts of some otherwise fearless and undaunted souls. Invite them to a party where they dont know anyone, and it mainlines queasiness into their veins. If this sounds familiar, take consolation from the fact that the brighter the individual, the more he or she detests small talk. When consulting for Fortune 500 companies, I was astounded. Top executives, completely comfortable making big talk with their boards of directors or addressing their stockholders, confessed they felt like little lost children at parties where the pratter was less than prodigious. Small-talk haters take further consolation from the fact that you are in star-studded company. Fear of small talk and stage fright are the same thing. The butterflies you feel in your stoach when youre in a roomful of strangers flutter round the tummies of top performers. Pablo Casals complained of lifelong stage fright. Carly Simon curtailed live performances because of it. A friend of mine who worked with Neil Diamond said he insisted the words to Song Sung Blue, a tune hed been crooning for forty years, be displayed on his teleprompter, lest fear freeze him into forgetfulness. Is Small-Talk-a-Phobia Curable? Someday, scientists say, communications fears may be treatable with drugs. Theyre already experimenting with Prozac to change peoples personalities. But some fear disastrous side effects. The good news is that when human beings think, and genuinely feel, certain emotionslike confidence that they have specific tecniques to fall back onthe brain manufactures its own antidotes. If fear and distaste of small talk is the disease, knowing solid tecniques like the ones we explore in this section is the cure. Incidentally, science is beginning to recognize its not chance or even upbringing that one person has a belly of butterflies and another doesnt. In our brains, neurons communicate through chemicals called neurotransmitters. Some people have excessive levels of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, a chemical cousin of adrenaline. For some children, just walking into a kindegarten room makes them want to run and hide under a table. As a tot, I spent a lot of time under the table. As a preteen in an all-girls boarding school, my legs turned to linguine every time I had to converse with a male. In eighth grade, I once had to invite a boy to our school prom. The entire selection of dancing males lived in the dormitory of our brother school. And I only knew one resident, Eugene. I had met Eugene at summer camp the year before. Mustering all my courage, I decided to call him. Two weeks before the dance, I felt the onset of sweaty palms. I put the call off. One week before, rapid heartbeat set in. I put How to Know What to Say After You Say Hi 45 the call off. Finally, three days before the big bash, breathing became difficult. Time was running out. The critical moment, I rationalized, would be easier if I read from a script. I wrote out the following: Hi, this is Leil. We met at camp last summer. Remember? (I programmed in a pause where I hoped he would say yes.) Well, National Cathedral Schools prom is this Saturday night and Id like you to be my date. (I programmed in another pause where I prayed hed say yes.) On Thursday before the dance, I could no longer delay the inevitable. I picked up the receiver and dialed. Clutching the phone waiting for Eugene to answer, my eyes followed perspirtion droplets rolling down my arm and dripping off my elbow. A small salty puddle was forming around my feet. Hello? a sexy, deep male voice answered the dorm phone. In faster-than-a-speeding-bullet voice, like a nervous novice telemarketer, I shot out, Hi, this is Leil. We-met-at-camplassummer-remember? Forgetting to pause for his assent, I raced on, Well-National-Cathedral-Schools-prom-is-this-Saturday-nigh and-Id-like-you-to-be-my-date. To my relief and delight, I heard a big, cheerful Oh thats great, Id love to! I exhaled my first normal breath all day. He cotinued, Ill pick you up at the girls dorm at 7:30. Ill have a pink carnation for you. Will that go with your dress? And my name is Donnie. Donnie? Donnie! Who said anything about Donnie? Well, Donnie turned out to be the best date I had that decade. Donnie had buckteeth, a head full of tousled red hair, and comunications skills that immediately put me at ease. On Saturday night, Donnie greeted me at the door, carnation in hand and grin on face. He joked self-deprecatingly about how he was dying to go to the prom so, knowing it was a case of mitaken identity, he accepted anyway. He told me he was thrilled when the girl with the lovely voice called, and he took full responsibility for tricking me into an invitation. Donnie made me comfortable and confident as we chatted. First we made small talk and then he gradually led me into subjects I was interested in. I flipped over Donnie, and he became my very first boyfriend. Donnie instinctively had the small-talk skills that we are now going to fashion into techniques to help you glide through small talk like a hot knife through butter. When you master them, you will be ablelike Donnieto melt the heart of everyone you touch. The goal of How to Talk to Anyone is not, of course, to make you a small-talk whiz and stop there. The aim is to make you a dynamic conversationalist and forceful communicator. However, small talk is the first crucial step toward that goal. How to Start Great Small Talk Youve been there. Youre introduced to someone at a party or busness meeting. You shake hands, your eyes meet . . . and suddenly your entire body of knowledge dries up and thought processes come to a screeching halt. You fish for a topic to fill the awkward silence. Failing, your new contact slips away in the direction of the cheese tray. We want the first words falling from our lips to be sparkling, witty, and insightful. We want our listeners to immediately reognize how riveting we are. I was once at a gathering where everbody was sparkling, witty, insightful, and riveting. It drove me berserk because most of these same everybodies felt they had to prove it in their first ten words or less! Several years ago, the Mensa organization, a social group of extremely bright individuals who score in the countrys top 2 pecent in intelligence, invited me to be a keynote speaker at their annual convention. Their cocktail party was in full swing in the lobby of the hotel as I arrived. After checking in, I hauled my bags through the hoard of happy-hour Mensans to the elevator. The doors separated and I stepped into an elevator packed with party goers. As we began the journey up to our respective floors, the el vator gave several sleepy jerks. Hmm, I remarked, in response to the elevators sluggisness, the elevator seems a little flaky. Suddenly, each elevator occupant, feeling compelled to exhibit his or her 132-plus IQ, pounced forth with a thunderous explanation. Its obviously got poor rail-guide alignment, announced one. The relay contact is not made up, declared another. Suddenly I felt like a grasshoper trapped in a stereo speaker. I couldnt wait to escape the attack of the mental giants. Afterward, in the solitude of my room, I thought back and reflected that the Mensans answers were, indeed, interesting. Why then did I have an adverse reaction? I realized it was too much, too soon. I was tired. Their high energy and intensity jarred my sluggish state. You see, small talk is not about facts or words. Its about music, about melody. Small talk is about putting people at ease. Its about making comforting noises together like cats purring, children humming, or groups chanting. You must first match your listeners mood. Like repeating the note on the music teachers harmonica, top communicators pick up on their listeners tone of voice and duplcate it. Instead of jumping in with such intensity, the Mensans could have momentarily matched my lethargic mood by saying, Yes, it is slow, isnt it? Had they then prefaced their information with, Have you ever been curious why an elevator is slow? I would have responded with a sincere Yes, I have. After a moment of equalized energy levels, I would have welcomed their explantions about the rail-guard alignment or whatever the heck it was. And friendships might have started. Im sure youve suffered the aggression of a mood mismatch. Have you ever been relaxing when some overexcited, hot-breathed colleague starts pounding you with questions? Or the reverse: youre late, rushing to a meeting, when an associate stops you and starts lazily narrating a long, languorous story. No matter how interesting the tale, you dont want to hear it now. The first step in starting a conversation without strangling it is to match your listeners mood, if only for a sentence or two. When it comes to small talk, think music, not words. Is your litener adagio or allegro? Match that pace. I call it Make a Mood Match. Matching Their Mood Can Make or Break the Sale Matching customers moods is crucial for salespeople. Some years ago, I decided to throw a surprise party for my best friend Stella. It was going to be a triple-whammy party because she was celbrating three events. One, it was Stellas birthday. Two, she was newly engaged. And three, Stella had just landed her dream job. She had been my buddy since grade school, and I was floating on air over her birthday-engagement-congratulations bash. I had heard one of the best French restaurants in town had an attractive back room for parties. About 5 p.m. one afternoon, I wafted happily into the restaurant and found the seated ma”tre d languidly looking over his reservation book. I began excitedly babling about Stellas triple-whammy celebration and asked to see that fabulous back room Id heard so much about. Without a smile or moving a muscle, he said, Zee room ees een zee back. You can go zee eet eef you like. CRASH. What a party pooper! His morose mood kicked all the party spirit out of me, and I no longer wanted to rent his stpid space. Before I even looked at the room, he lost the rental. I left his restaurant vowing to find a place where the management would at least appear to share the joy of the happy occasion. Every mother knows this instinctively. To quiet a whimpering infant, Mama doesnt just shake her finger and shout, Quiet down. No, Mama picks baby up. Mama cries, Ooh, ooh, oh, sympathetically matching babys misery for a few moments. Mama then gradually transitions the two of them into hush-hush happy How to Start Great Small Talk 49 sounds. Your listeners are all big babies! Match their mood if you want them to stop crying, start buying, or otherwise come round to your way of thinking. Technique #10 Make a Mood Match Before opening your mouth, take a voice sample of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a psychic photograph of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment. How to Sound Like Youve Got a Super Personality (No Matter What Youre Saying!) Once while at a party, I spotted a fellow surrounded by a fan club of avid listeners. The chap was smiling, gesticulating, and obvously enthralling his audience. I went over to hearken to this facinating speaker. I joined his throng of admirers and eavesdropped for a minute or two. Suddenly, it dawned on me: the fellow was saying the most banal things! His script was dull, dull, dull. Ah, but he was delivering his prosaic observations with such passion, and therefore, he held the group spellbound. It convinced me that its not all what you say, its how you say it. Whats a Good Opening Line When I Meet People? I am often asked this question, and I give them the same answer a woman who once worked in my office always gave me. Dottie often stayed at her desk to work through lunch. Sometimes, as I was leaving for the sandwich shop, Id ask her, Hey Dottie, what can I bring you back for lunch? Dottie, trying to be obliging, would say, Oh anything is fine with me. No, Dottie! I wanted to scream. Tell me what you want. Ham n cheese on rye? Bologna on whole wheat, hold the mayo? Peanut butter n jelly with sliced bananas? Be specific. Anything is a hassle. Frustrating though it may be, my answer to the opening-line question is Anything! because almost anything you say really is OKas long as it puts people at ease and sounds passionate. How do you put people at ease? By convincing them they are OK and that the two of you are similar. When you do that, you break down walls of fear, suspicion, and mistrust. Why Banal Makes a Bond Samuel I. Hayakawa was a college president, U.S. senator, and brilliant linguistic analyst of Japanese origin. He tells us this story that shows the value of, as he says, unoriginal remarks. 11 In early 1943after the attack on Pearl Harbor at a time when there were rumors of Japanese spiesHayakawa had to wait seeral hours in a railroad station in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He noticed others waiting in the station were staring at him suspiciously. Because of the war, they were apprehensive about his presence. He later wrote, One couple with a small child was staring with spcial uneasiness and whispering to each other. So what did Hayakawa do? He made unoriginal remarks to set them at ease. He said to the husband that it was too bad the train should be late on so cold a night. The man agreed. I went on, Hayakawa wrote, to remark that it must be espcially difficult to travel with a small child in winter when train schedules were so uncertain. Again the husband agreed. I then asked the childs age and remarked that their child looked very big How to Sound Like Youve Got a Super Personality 53 and strong for his age. Again agreement, this time with a slight smile. The tension was relaxing. After two or three more exchanges, the man asked Hayakawa, I hope you dont mind my bringing it up, but youre Japanese, arent you? Do you think the Japs have any chance of winning this war? Well, Hayakawa replied, your guess is as good as mine. I dont know any more than I read in the papers. But the way I fiure it, I dont see how the Japanese, with their lack of coal and steel and oil . . . can ever beat a powerfully industrialized nation like the United States. Hayakawa went on, My remark was admittedly neither oriinal nor well informed. Hundreds of radio commentators . . . were saying much the same thing during those weeks. But just because they were, the remark sounded familiar and was on the right side so that it was easy to agree with. The Wisconsin man agreed at once with what seemed like genuine relief. His next remark was, Say, I hope your folks arent over there while the war is going on. Yes, they are, Hayakawa replied. My father and mother and two young sisters are over there. Do you ever hear from them? the man asked. How can I? Hayakawa answered. Both the man and his wife looked troubled and sympathetic. Do you mean you wont be able to see them or hear from them until after the war is over? There was more to the conversation but the result was, within ten minutes they had invited Hayakawawhom they initially may have suspected was a Japanese spyto visit them sometime in their city and have dinner in their home. And all because of this brilliant scholars admittedly common and unoriginal small talk. Top communicators know the most soothing and appropriate first words should be, like Senator Hayakawas, unoriginal, even banal. But not indifferent. Hayakawa delivered his sentiments with sicerity and passion. Ascent from Banality It is not necessary, of course, to stay with mundane remarks. If you find your company displays cleverness or wit, you match that. The conversation then escalates naturally, compatibly. Dont rush it or, like the Mensans, you seem like youre showing off. The bo tom line on your first words is to have the courage of your own triteness. Because, remember, people tune in to your tone more than your text. Anything, Except Liverwurst! Back to Dottie waiting for her sandwich at her desk. Sometimes as I walked out the door scratching my head wondering what to bring her, shed call after me, Anything, except liverwurst, that is. Thanks, Dottie, thats a little bit of help. Heres my anything, except liverwurst on small talk. Anthing you say is fine as long as it is not complaining, rude, or Technique #11 Prosaic with Passion Worried about your first words? Fear not, because 80 percent of your listeners impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting. How to Sound Like Youve Got a Super Personality 55 unpleasant. If the first words out of your mouth are a complaint BLAMpeople label you a complainer. Why? Because that coplaint is your new acquaintances 100 percent sampling of you so far. You could be the happiest Pollyanna ever, but how will they know? If your first comment is a complaint, youre a griper. If your first words are rude, youre a creep. If your first words are unpleaant, youre a stinker. Open and shut. Other than these downers, anything goes. Ask them where theyre from, how they know the host of the party, where they bought the lovely suit theyre wearingor hundreds of etceteras. The trick is to ask your prosaic question with passion to get the other person talking. Still feel a bit shaky on making the approach to strangers? Lets take a quick detour on our road to meaningful communicating. Ill give you three quickie techniques to meet people at parties then nine more to make small talk not so small. How to Make People Want to Start a Conversation with You Singles proficient at meeting potential sweethearts without the benefit of introduction (in the vernacular, making a pickup), have developed a deliciously devious technique that works equally well for social or corporate networking purposes. The technique requires no exceptional skill on your part, only the courage to sport a simple visual prop called a Whatzit. Whats a Whatzit? A Whatzit is anything you wear or carry that is unusuala unique pin, an interesting purse, a strange tie, or an amusing hat. A Whatzit is any object that draws peoples attention and inspires them to approach you and ask, Uh, whats that? Your Whatzit can be as subtle or overt as your personality and the occasion permit. I wear around my neck an outmoded pair of glasses that resebles a double monocle. Often the curious have approached me at a gathering and asked, Whatzit? I explain its a lorgnette left to me by my grandmother, which, of course, paves the way to discuss hatred of glasses, aging eyes, love or loss of grandmothers, adortion of antique jewelryanywhere the inquisitor wants to take it. Perhaps, unknowingly, you have fallen prey to this soon-tbe-legendary technique. At a gathering, have you ever noticed How to Make People Want to Start a Conversation with You 57 someone you would like to talk to? Then youve racked your brain to conjure an excuse to make the approach. What a bounty it was to discover that he or she was wearing some weird, wild, or woderful something you could comment on. The Whatzit Way to Love Your Whatzit is a social aid whether you seek business rewards or new romance. My friend Alexander carries Greek worry beads with him wherever he goes. Hes not worried. He knows any woman who wants to talk to him will come up and say, Whats that? Think about it, gentlemen. Suppose youre at a party. An attractive woman spots you across the room. She wants to talk to you but shes thinking, Well, Mister, youre attractive. But, golly, what can I say to you? You just aint got no Whatzit. Be a Whatzit Seeker, Too Likewise, become proficient in scrutinizing the apparel of those you wish to approach. Why not express interest in the handkechief in the tycoons vest pocket, the brooch on the bosom of the rich divorcŽe, or the school ring on the finger of the CEO whose company you want to work for? The big spender who, you suspect, might buy a hundred of your widgets has a tiny golf-club lapel pin? Say, Excuse me, I couldnt help but notice your attractive lapel pin. Are you a golfer? Me, too. What courses have you played? Your business cards and your Whatzit are crucial socializing artifacts. Whether you are riding in the elevator, climbing the doorstep, or traversing the path to the party, make sure your Whatzit is hanging out for all to see. Technique #12 Always Wear a Whatzit Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. Excuse me, I couldnt help but notice your . . . what IS that? The next quickie technique was originated by doggedly dtermined politicians who dont let one partygoer escape if they think he or she could be helpful to their campaigns. I call it the Whoozat technique. How to Meet the People You Want to Meet Say you have scrutinized the body of the important business cotact you want to meet. Youve searched in vain from the tip of his cowlick to the toes of his boots. Hes not sporting a single Whatzit. If you strike out on finding something to comment on, resort to the Whoozat technique. Like a persistent politician, go to the party giver and say, That man/woman over there looks interesing. Who is he/she? Then ask for an introduction. Dont be heitant. The party giver will be pleased you find one of the guests interesting. If, however, you are loath to pull the party giver away from his or her other guests, you still can perform Whoozat. This time, dont ask for a formal introduction. Simply pump the party giver for just enough information to launch you. Find out about the strangers jobs, interests, and hobbies. Suppose the party giver says, Oh, thats Joe Smith. Im not sure what his job is, but I know he loves to ski. Aha, youve just been given the icebreaker you need. Now you make a beeline for Joe Smith. Hi, youre Joe Smith, arent you? Susan was just telling me what a great skier you are. Where do you ski? You get the idea. Technique #13 Whoozat Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by nopoliticians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers. Now the third in our little trio of meeting-who-you-want tricks. How to Break into a Tight Crowd The woman youve decided you MUST meet is wearing no Whatzit? Cant find the host for the Whoozat technique? To make matters worse, shes deep in conversation with a group of her friends. Seems quite hopeless that you will maneuver a meeting, doesnt it? You cant just say, Excuse me, I just thought Id eavedrop in and say Hello. No obstacle blocks the resolute politician, who always has a trick or ten up his or her sleeve. A politico would resort to the Eavesdrop In technique. Eavesdropping, of course, conjures images of clandestine activitieswiretapping, Watergate breains, or spies skulking around in the murky shadows. Eavesdroping has historical precedent with politicians so, in a pinch, it naturally comes to mind. At parties, stand near the group of people you wish to infitrate. Then wait for a word or two you can use as a wedge to break into the group. Excuse me, I couldnt help overhearing that you . . . and then whatever is relevant here. For example I couldnt help overhearing your discussion of Bermuda. Im going there next month for the first time. Any suggestions? Now you are in the circle and can direct your comments to your intended. Technique #14 Eavesdrop In No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infitrate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with Excuse me, I couldnt help but overhear. . . . Will they be taken aback? Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily. Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely! Let us now hop back on the train that first explored Small Talk City and travel to the land of Meaningful Communicating. How to Make Where Are You From? Sound Exciting You wouldnt dream of going to a party naked. And I hope you wouldnt dream of letting your conversation be exposed naked and defenseless against the two inevitable assaults Where are you from? and What do you do? When asked these questions, most people, like clunking a frzen steak on a china platter, drop a brick of frozen geography or baffling job title on the askers conversational platter. Then they slap on the muzzle. Youre at a convention. Everyone you meet will, of course, ask And where are you from? When you give them the short-form naked-city answer Oh, Im from Muscatine, Iowa (or Mill nocket, Maine; Winnemucca, Nevada; or anywhere they havent heard of ), what can you expect except a blank stare? Even if youre a relatively big city slicker from Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michgan; or San Diego, California, youll receive a panicked look from all but American history professors. Theyre rapidly racking their brains thinking What do I say next? Even the names of worlclass burgs like New York, Chicago, Washington, and Los Angles inspire less-than-riveting responses. When I tell people Im from New York City, what are they expected to say? Duh, seen any good muggings lately? Do humanity and yourself a favor. Never, ever, give just a onsentence response to the question, Where are you from? Give the asker some fuel for his tank, some fodder for his trough. Give the hugry communicator something to conversationally nibble on. All it takes is an extra sentence or two about your citysome interesting fact, some witty observationto hook the asker into the conversation. Several months ago, a trade association invited me to be its keynote speaker on networking and teaching people to be better conversationalists. Just before my speech, I was introduced to Mrs. Devlin, who was the head of the association. How do you do? she asked. How do you do? I replied. Then Mrs. Devlin smiled, anxiously awaiting a sample of my stimulating conversational expertise. I asked her where she was from. She plunked a frozen Columbus, Ohio and a big expectant grin on my platter. I had to quickly thaw her answer into digestible conversation. My mind thrashed into action. Leils thought patern: Gulp, Columbus, Ohio. Ive never been there, hmm. Criiny, what do I know about Columbus? I know a fellow named Jeff, a successful speaker who lives there. But Columbus is too big to ask if she knows him . . . and besides only kids play the Do-yoknow-so-and-so game. My panicked silent search continued. I think its named after Christopher Columbus . . . but Im not sure, so I better keep my mouth shut on that one. Four or five other possibilities raced through my mind but I rejected them all as too obvious, too adolescent, or too off-the-wall. I realized by now that seconds had passed, and Mrs. Devlin was still standing there with a slowly dissipating smile on her face. She was waiting for me (the expert who, within the hour, was expected to teach her trade association lessons on scintillating coversation) to spew forth words of wit or wisdom. Oh, Columbus, gee, I mumbled in desperation, watching her face fall into the worried expression of a patient being asked by the surgeon, knife poised in hand, Wheres your appendix? How to Make Where Are You From? Sound Exciting 65 I never came up with stimulating conversation on Columbus. But, just then, under the knife, I created the following technique for posterity. I call it Never the Naked City. Different Bait for Shrimp or Sharks A fisherman uses different bait to bag bass or bluefish. And you will obviously throw out different conversational bait to snag siple shrimp or sophisticated sharks. Your hook should relate to the type of person youre speaking with. Im originally from Wasington, D.C. If someone at, say, an art gallery asked me where I was from, I might answer Washington, D.C.designed, you know, by the same city planner who designed Paris. This opens the conversational possibilities to the artistry of city planning, Paris, other cities plans, European travel, and so forth. At a social party of singles Id opt for another answer. Im from Washington, D.C. The reason I left is there were seven women to every man when I was growing up. Now the convesation can turn to the ecstasy or agony of being single, the peceived lack of desirable men everywhere, or even flirtatious possibilities. Technique #15 Never the Naked City Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, And where are you from? never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think youre a great conversationalist. In a political group, Id cast a current fact from the constantly evolving political face of Washington. No need to speculate on the multitude of conversational possibilities that unlocks. Where do you get your conversational bait? Start by phoning the chamber of commerce or historical society of your town. Search the World Wide Web and click on your town, or open an old-fashioned encyclopediaall rich sources for future stimulaing conversations. Learn some history, geography, business statitics, or perhaps a few fun facts to tickle future friends funny bones. The Devlin debacle inspired further research. The minute I got home, I called the Columbus chamber of commerce and the historical society. Say you, too, are from Columbus, Ohio, and your new acquaintance lays it on you: Where are you from? When you are talking with a businessperson, your answer could be, Im from Columbus, Ohio. You know many major corpor tions do their product testing in Columbus because its so comercially typical. In fact, its been called the most American city in America. They say if it booms or bombs in Columbus, it booms or bombs nationally. Talking with someone with a German last name? Tell her about Columbuss historic German Village with the brick streets and the wonderful 1850s-style little houses. Its bound to inspire stories of the old country. Your conversation partners surname is Italian? Tell him Genoa, Italy, is Columbuss sister city. Talking with an American history buff ? Tell him that Colubus was, indeed, named after Christopher Columbus and that a replica of the Santa Maria is anchored in the Scioto River. Taling with a student? Tell her about the five universities in Columbus. The possibilities continue. You suspect your conversation parner has an artistic bent? Ah, you throw out casually, Columbus is the home of artist George Bellows. Columbusites, prepare some tasty snacks for askers even if you know nothing about them. Heres a goodie. Tell them you How to Make Where Are You From? Sound Exciting 67 always have to say Columbus, Ohio because there is also a Clumbus, Arkansas; Columbus, Georgia; Columbus, Indiana; Columbus, Kansas; Columbus, Kentucky; Columbus, Mississippi; Columbus, Montana; Columbus, Nebraska; Columbus, New Jesey; Columbus, New Mexico; Columbus, North Carolina; Colubus, North Dakota; Columbus, Pennsylvania; Columbus, Texas; and Columbus, Wisconsin. That spreads the conversational possbilities to fifteen other states. Remember, as a quotable notable once said, No man would listen to you talk if he didnt know it was his turn next. A postscript to the hellish experience I had with Columbus. Months later, I mentioned the trauma to my speaker friend from Columbus, Jeff. Jeff explained his house was really in a smaller town just minutes outside Columbus. What town, Jeff ? Gahanna, Ohio. Gahanna means hell in Hebrew, he said, and then went on to explain why he thought ancient Hebrew hitorians were clairvoyant. Thanks, Jeff, I knew youd never lay a naked city on any of your listeners. How to Come Out a Winner Every Time They Ask, And What Do You Do? Third only to death and taxes is the assurance a new acquaintance will soon chirp, And what do you do? (Is it fitting and proper they should make that query? Well pick up that sticky wicket later.) For the moment, these few defensive moves help you keep your crackerjack communicator credentials when asked the inevitable question. First, like Never the Naked City, dont toss a short-shrift answer in response to the askers breathless inquiry. You leave the poor fish flopping on the deck when you just say your title: Im an actuary/an auditor/an author/an astrophysicist. Have mercy so he or she doesnt feel like a nincompoop outsider asking, What, er, kind of actuizing (auditing, authoring, or astrophysizing) do you do? Youre an attorney. Dont leave it to laymen to try to figure out what you really do. Flesh it out. Tell a little story your converstion partner can get a handle on. For example, if youre talking with a young mother say, Im an attorney. Our firm specializes in employment law. In fact, now Im involved in a case where a comHow to Come Out a Winner Every Time They Ask, And What Do You Do? 69 Technique #16 Never the Naked Job When asked the inevitable And what do you do, you may think Im an economist/an educator/an engineer is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying Im a paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer. Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, theyll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray. pany actually discharged a woman for taking extra maternity leave that was a medical necessity. A mother can relate to that. Talking with a business owner? Say Im an attorney. Our firm specializes in employment law. My current case concerns an employer who is being sued by one of her staff for asking personal questions during the initial job interview. A business owner can relate to that. Painful Memories of Naked Job Flashers I still harbor painful recollections of being tongue-tied when cofronted by naked job flashers. Like the time a fellow at a dinner party told me, Im a nuclear scientist. My weak Oh, that must be fascinating reduced me to a mental molecule in his eyes. The chap on my other side announced, Im in industrial abrsives, and then paused, waiting for me to be impressed. My Well, er, golly, you must have to be a shrewd judge of character to be in industrial abrasives didnt fly either. We three sat in silence the rest of the meal. Just last month a new acquaintance bragged, Im planning to teach Tibetan Buddhism at Truckee Meadows Community Colege, and then clammed up. I knew less about Truckee Meadows than I did about Tibetan Buddhism. Whenever people ask you what you do, give them some mouth-to-ear resuscitation so they can catch their breath and say something. How to Introduce People Like the Host(ess) with the Most(est) It is important to help newlymets through their first nervous moments. Susan, Id like you to meet John Smith. John, this is Susan Jones. Duh, what do you expect John and Susan to say? Smith? Umm, thats S-M-I-T-H, isnt it? Uh, er, golly, Susan, well, now, theres an interesting name. Nice-try-forget-it. Dont blame John or Susan for being less than scintillating. The fault lies with the person who introduced the two the way most people introduce their friends to each otherwith naked names. They cast out a line with no bait for people to sink their teeth into. Big winners may not talk a lot, but conversation never dies unwillingly in their midst. They make sure of it with techniques like Never the Naked Introduction. When they introduce peple, they buy an insurance policy on the conversation with a few simple add-ons: Susan, Id like you to meet John. John has a woderful boat we took a trip on last summer. John, this is Susan Smith. Susan is editor in chief of Shoestring Gourmet magazine. Padding the introduction gives Susan the opportunity to ask what kind of boat John has or where the group went. It gives John an opening to discuss his love of writing. Or of cooking. Or of food. The conversation can then naturally expand to travel in geeral, life on boats, past vacations, favorite recipes, restaurants, bugets, diets, magazines, editorial policyto infinity. If youre not comfortable mentioning someones job during the introduction, mention their hobby or even a talent. The other day at a gathering, the hostess introduced a man named Gilbert. She said, Leil, Id like you to meet Gilbert. Gilberts gift is sculping. He makes beautiful wax carvings. I remember thinking, Giftnow thats a lovely way to introduce someone and induce conversation. Armed with these two personality enhancers, three converstion igniters, and three small extenders, it is time to take a step up the communications ladder. Let us now rise from small talk and seek the path to more meaningful dialogue. The next technique is guaranteed to make the exchange engrossing for your converstion partner. Technique #17 Never the Naked Introduction When introducing people, dont throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then youre free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity. How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation Even a well-intentioned husband who might ask his wife while making love, Is it good for you, too, Honey? knows not to ask a colleague, Is the conversation good for you, too? Yet he woders . . . we all do. With the following technique, set your mind at rest. You can definitely make the conversation hot for anyone with whom you speak. Like my prom date, Donnie, you will miraculously find subjects to engross your listeners. Be a Sleuth on Their Slips of the Tongue No matter how elusive the clue, Sherlock Holmes is confident hell soon be staring right at it through his magnifying glass. Like the unerring detective, big winners know, no matter how elusive the clue, theyll find the right topic. How? They become word detectives. I have a young friend, Nancy, who works in a nursing home. Nancy cares deeply about the elderly but often grumbles about how crotchety and laconic some of her patients are. She laments she has difficulty relating to them. Nancy told me about one especially cantankerous old woman named Mrs. Otis, whom she could never get to open up to her. One day, Nancy confided, right after all those rainstorms we had last week, just to make conversation, I remarked to Mrs. Otis, Terrible storms we had last week, dont you think? Well, Nancy continued, Mrs. Otis practically jumped down my throat. She said in a snippy voice, Its been good for the plants. I asked Nancy how she responded to that. What could I say? Nancy answered. The woman was obvously cutting me off. Did you ever think to ask Mrs. Otis if she liked plants? Plants? Nancy asked. Well, yes, I suggested. Mrs. Otis brought the subject up. I asked Nancy to do me a favor. Ask her, I begged. Nancy rsisted, but I persisted. Just to quiet me down, Nancy promised to ask cantankerous old Mrs. Otis if she liked plants. The next day, a flabbergasted Nancy called me from work. Leil, how did you know? Not only did Mrs. Otis love plants, but she told me shed been married to a gardener. Today I had a diferent problem with Mrs. Otis. I couldnt shut her up! She went on and on about her garden, her husband. . . . Top communicators know ideas dont come out of nowhere. If Mrs. Otis thought to bring up plants, then she must have some relationship with them. Furthermore, by mentioning the word, it meant subconsciously she wanted to talk about plants. Suppose, for example, instead of responding to Nancys coment about the rain with Its good for the plants, Mrs. Otis had said, Because of the rain, my dog couldnt go out. Nancy could then ask about her dog. Or suppose she grumbled, Its bad for my arthritis. Can you guess what old Mrs. Otis wants to talk about now? When talking with anyone, keep your ears open and, like a good detective, listen for clues. Be on the lookout for any unusual references: any anomaly, deviation, digression, or invocation of How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation 75 another place, time, person. Ask about it because its the clue to what your conversation partner would really enjoy discussing. If two people have something in common, when the shared interest comes up, they jump on it naturally. For example, if somone mentions playing squash (bird-watching or stamp collecting) and the listener shares that passion, he or she pipes up, Oh, youre a squasher (or birder or philatelist), too! Heres the trick: theres no need to be a squasher, birder, or philatelist to pipe up with enthusiasm. You can simply Be a Word Detective. When you pick up on the reference as though it excites you, too, it parlays you into conversation the stranger thrills to. (The subject may put your feet to sleep, but thats another story.) Now that youve ignited stimulating conversation, lets explore a technique to keep it hot. Technique #18 Be a Word Detective Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partners every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject thats hot for the other person. How to Enthrall Em with Your Choice of TopicThem! Several years ago, a girlfriend and I attended a party saturated with a hodgepodge of swellegant folks. Everyone we talked to seemed to lead a nifty life. Discussing the party afterward, I asked my friend, Diane, of all the exciting people at the party, who did you enjoy talking to most? Without hesitation she said, Oh by far, Dan Smith. What does Dan do? I asked her. Uh, well, Im not sure, she answered. Where does he live? Uh, I dont know, Diane responded. Well, what is he interested in? Well, we really didnt talk about his interests. Diane, I asked, what did you talk about? Well, I guess we talked mostly about me. Aha, I thought. Diane has just rubbed noses with a winner. As it turns out, I had the pleasure of meeting Big-Winner Dan several months later. Dianes ignorance about his life piqued my curiosity so I grilled him for details. As it turns out, Dan lives in Paris, has a beach home in the south of France, and a mountain home in the Alps. He travels around the world producing sound and light shows for pyramids and ancient ruinsand he is an avid hang How to Enthrall Em with Your Choice of TopicThem! 77 glider and scuba diver. Does this man have an interesting life or what? Yet Dan, when meeting Diane, said nothing about himself. I told Dan about how pleased Diane was to meet him yet how little she learned about his life. Dan simply replied, Well, when I meet someone, I learn so much more if I ask about their life. I always try to turn the spotlight on the other person. Truly cofident people often do this. They know they grow more by listeing than talking. Obviously, they also captivate the talker. Sell Yourself with a Top Sales Technique Several months ago at a speakers convention, I was talking with a colleague Brian Tracy. Brian does a brilliant job of training top salespeople. He tells his students of a giant spotlight that, when shining on their product, is not as interesting to the prospect. When they shine the spotlight on the prospect, they make the sale. Salespeople, this technique is especially crucial for you. Keep your Swiveling Spotlight aimed away from you, only lightly on your product, and most brightly on your buyer. Youll do a much better job of selling yourself and your product. Technique #19 The Swiveling Spotlight When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When youre talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, its shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you. How to Never Need to Wonder, What Do I Say Next? Moments arise, of course, when even conversationalists extraordnaire hit the wall. Some folks monosyllabic grunts leave slim picings even for masters of the Be a Word Detective technique. If you find yourself futilely fanning the embers of a dying conversation (and if you feel for political reasons or human copassion that the conversation should continue), heres a foolproof trick to get the fire blazing again. I call it Parroting after that beautiful tropical bird that captures everyones heart simply by repeating other peoples words. Have you ever, puttering around the house, had the TV in the background tuned to a tennis game? You hear the ball going back and forth over the netklink-klunk, klink-klunk, klink . . . this time you dont hear the klunk. The ball didnt hit the court. What happened? You immediately look up at the set. Likewise in conversation, the conversational ball goes back and forth. First you speak, then your partner speaks, you speak . . . and so it goes, back and forth. Each time, through a series of nods and comforting grunts like um hum, or umm, you let your co versation partner know the ball has landed in your court. Its your I got it signal. Such is the rhythm of conversation. How to Never Need to Wonder, What Do I Say Next? 79 What Do I Say Next? Back to that frightfully familiar moment when it is your turn to speak but your mind goes blank. Dont panic. Instead of signaing verbally or nonverbally that you got it, simply repeator parrotthe last two or three words your companion said, in a sympathetic, questioning tone. That throws the conversational ball right back in your partners court. My friend Phil sometimes picks me up at the airport. Usually I am so exhausted that I rudely fall asleep in the passenger seat, relegating Phil to nothing more than a chauffeur. After one especially exhausting trip some years ago, I flung my bags in his trunk and flopped onto the front seat. As I was dozing off, he mentioned hed gone to the theater the night before. Usually I would have just grunted and wafted into unconsciouness. However, on this particular trip, I had learned the Paroting technique and was eager to try it. Theater? I parroted quizzically. Yes, it was a great show, he replied, fully expecting it to be the last word on the subject before I fell into my usual sleepy stupor. Great show? I parroted. Pleasantly surprised by my interest, he said, Yes, its a new show by Stephen Sondheim called Sweeney Todd. Sweeney Todd ? I again parroted. Now Phil was getting fired up. Yeah, great music and an unbelievably bizarre story. . . . Bizarre story? I parroted. Well, thats all Phil needed. For the next half an hour, Phil told me the shows story about a Lodon barber who went around murdering people. I half dozed, but soon decided his tale of Sweeney Todds cutting off peoples heads was disturbing my sleepy reverie. So I simply backed up and paroted one of his previous phrases to get him on another track. You said it had great music? That did the trick. For the rest of the forty-five-minute trip to my home, Phil sang me Pretty Women, The Best Pies in Lodon, and other songs from Sweeney Toddmuch better accopaniment for my demi-nap. Im sure, to this day, Phil thinks of that trip as one of the best conversations we ever had. And all I did was parrot a few of his phrases. Salespeople, why go on a wild goose chase for a customers real objections when its so easy to shake them out of the trees with Parroting? Parroting Your Way to Profits Parroting is also a can opener to pry open peoples real feelings. Star salespeople use it to get to their prospects emotional objetions, which they often dont even articulate to themselves. A friend of mine, Paul, a used-car salesman, told me he credits a recent sale of a Lamborghini to Parroting. Paul was walking around the lot with a prospect and his wife, who had expressed interest in a sensible car. He was showing them every sensible Chevy and Ford on the lot. As they were looing at one very sensible family car, Paul asked the husband what he thought of it. Well, he mused, Im not sure this car is right Technique #20 Parroting Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen. How to Never Need to Wonder, What Do I Say Next? 81 for me. Instead of moving on to the next sensible car, Paul paroted Right for you? Pauls questioning inflection signaled the prospect that he needed to say more. Well, er, yeah, the prospect mumbled. Im not sure it fits my personality. Fits your personality? Paul again parroted. You know, maybe I need something a little more sporty. A little more sporty? Paul parroted. Well, those cars over there look a little more sporty. Aha! Pauls parrot had ferreted out which cars to show the customer. As they walked over toward a Lamborghini on the lot, Paul saw the prospects eyes light up. An hour later, Paul had pocketed a fat commission. Want to take a rest from talking to save your throat? This next technique gets your conversation partner off and running so all you have to do is listen (or even sneak off unnoticed as he or she chats congenially away). How to Get Em Happily Chatting (So You Can Slip Away if You Want To!) Every father smiles when his little tyke beseeches him at bedtime, Daddy, Daddy, tell me the story again of the three little pigs (or the dancing princesses or how you and Mommy met). Daddy knows Junior enjoyed the story so much the first time, he wants to hear it again and again. Junior inspires the following technique called Encore! which serves two purposes. Encore! makes a colleague feel like a hapy dad, and its a great way to give dying conversation a heart transplant. I once worked on a ship that had Italian officers and mostly American passengers. Each week, the deck officers were required to attend the captains cocktail party. After the captains address in charmingly broken English, the officers invariably clumped together yakking it up in Italian. Needless to say, most of the pasengers grasp of Italian ended at macaroni, spaghetti, salami, and pizza. As cruise director, it fell on my shoulders to get the officers to mingle with the passengers. My not-so-subtle tactic was to grab one of the officers arms and literally drag him over to a smiling throng of expectant passengers. I would then introduce the offcer and pray that either the cat would release his tongue, or a pasHow to Get Em Happily Chatting (So You Can Slip Away if You Want To!) 83 senger would come up with a more original question than Gee, if all you officers are here, who is driving the boat? Never hapened. I dreaded the weekly captains cocktail party. One night, sleeping in my cabin, I was awakened by the ship rocking violently from side to side. I listened and the engines were off. A bad sign. I grabbed my robe and raced up to the deck. Through the dense fog, I could barely discern another ship not half a mile from us. Five or six officers were grasping the starboard guardrail and leaning overboard. I rushed over just in time to see a man in the moonlight with a bandage over one eye struggling up our violently rocking ladder. The officers immediately whisked him off to our ships hospital. The engines started again and we were on our way. The next morning I got the full story. A laborer on the other ship, a freighter, had been drilling a hole in an engine cylinder. While he was working, a sharp, needle-thin piece of metal shot like a missile into his right eye. The freighter had no doctor on board so the ship broadcast an emergency signal. International sea laws dictate that any ship hearing a distress signal must respond. Our ship came to the rescue and the seaman, clutching his bleeding eye, was lowered into a lifeboat that brought him to our ship. Dr. Rossi, our ships doctor, was successfully able to remove the needle from the workmans eye, thus saving his eyesight. Tell Em About the Time You . . . Cut to the next captains cocktail party. Once again I was faced with the familiar challenge of getting officers to mingle and make small talk with the passengers. I made my weekly trek to the laconic officers throng to drag one or two away and, this time, my hand fell on the arm of the ships doctor. I hauled him over to the nearest group of grinning passengers and introduced him. I then said, Just last week Dr. Rossi saved the eyesight of a seaman on another ship after a dramatic midnight rescue. Dr. Rossi, Im sure these folks would love to hear about it. It was like a magic wand. To my amazement, it was as though Dr. Rossi was blessed instantly with the tongues of angels. His prviously monosyllabic broken English became thickly accented elquence. He recounted the entire story for the growing group of passengers gathering around him. I left the throng that Dr. Rossi enraptured to pull another officer over to an awaiting audience. I grabbed the captains stripe-covered arm, dragged him over to another pack of smiling passengers and said, Captain Cafiero, why dont you tell these folks about the dramatic midnight rescue you made last week? The cat released Cafieros tongue and he was off and running. Back to the throng to get the first officer for the next group. By now I knew I had a winner. Signor Salvago, why dont you tell these folks how you awakened the captain at midnight last week for the dramatic midnight rescue? By then it was time to go back to extract the ships doctor from the first bevy and take him to his next pack of passengers. It worked even better the second time. He happily commenced his Encore! for the second audience. As he chatted away, I raced back to the captain to pull him away for a second telling with another throng. I felt like the circus juggler who keeps all the plates spinning on sticks. Just as I got one conversation spinning, I had to race back to the first speaker to give him a whirl at another audience. The captains cocktail parties were a breeze for me for the rest of the season. The three officers loved telling the same story of their heroism to new people every cruise. The only problem was I noticed the stories getting longer and more elaborate each time. I had to adjust my timing in getting them to do a repeat perfomance for the next audience. How to Get Em Happily Chatting (So You Can Slip Away if You Want To!) 85 Play It Again, Sam Encore! is what appreciative audiences chant when they want another song from the singer, another dance from the dancer, another poem from the poet, and in my case, another storytelling from the officers. Encore! is the technique you can use to request a repeat story from a prospect, potential employer, or valued acquaintance. While the two of you are chatting with a group of people, simply turn to him and say, John, I bet everyone would love to hear about the time you caught that thirty-pound striped bass. Or, Susan, tell everyone that story you just told me of how you rescued the kitten from the tree. He or she will, of course, demure. Insist! Your conversation partner is secretly loving it. The subtext of your request is That story of yours was so terrific, I want my other friends to hear it. After all, only crowd pleasers are asked to do an Encore! Technique #21 Encore! The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is Encore! Encore! Lets hear it again! The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when youre talking with a group of people is Tell them about the time you . . . Whenever youre at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance. The added benefit of this technique is that, once youve got them up and running with their conversation, you can sneak off and find more interesting company! One word of warning: make sure the story you request is one in which the teller shines. No one wants to retell the time they lost the sale, cracked up the car, or broke up the bar and spent the night in jail. Make sure your requested Encore! is a positive story where they come out the big winner, not the buffoon. The full beauty of this technique will hit you like a happy thunderbolt the first time you use it with someone who is telling a long and wearisome tale. You simply tiptoe away and let the bore spin the story on and on with your friend. (Of course, your friend may never speak to you again. But thats not germaine to this chapter!) The next technique deals with sharing some positive stories of your life. How to Come Across as a Positive Person Often people think when they meet someone they like, they should share a secret, reveal an intimacy, or make a confession of sorts to show they are human too. Airing your youthful battle with bed-wetting, teeth grinding, or thumb suckingor your present struggle with gout or a goitersupposedly endears you to the masses. Well, sometimes it does. One study showed that if someone is above you in stature, their revealing a foible brings them closer to you.The holes in the bottom of presidential candidate Adlai Stevensons shoes charmed a nation, as did George H. W. Bushs shocking admission that he couldnt stomach broccoli. If youre on sure footing, say a superstar who wants to become friends with a fan, go ahead and tell your devotees about the time you were out of work and penniless. But if youre not a superstar, better play it safe and keep the skeletons in the closet until later. People dont know you well enough to put your foible in context. Later in a relationship, telling your new friend youve been thrice married, you got caught shoplifting as a teenager, and you got turned down for a big job may be no big deal. And that may be the extent of what could be construed as black marks on an otherwise flawless life of solid relationships, no misdemeanors, and an impressive professional record. But very early in a relationship, the instinctive reaction is What else is coming? If he shares that with me so quickly, what else is he hiding? A closetful of espouses, a criminal record, walls papered with rejection letters? Your new acquaintance has no way of knowing your confession was a generous act, a well-intentioned revelation, on your part. So far, in this section, you have found assertive methods for meeting people and mastering small talk. The next is both an assertive and defensive move to help spare you that pasty smile we tend to sport when we have no idea what people are talking about. Technique #22 Ac-cen-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But nows the time, as the old song says, to ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive. How to Always Have Something Interesting to Say Youve heard folks whine, I cant go to the party, I havent got a thing to wear. When was the last time you heard, I cant go to the party, I havent got a thing to say? When going to a gathering with great networking possibilties, you naturally plan your outfit and make sure your shoes will match. And, of course, you must have just the right tie or correct color lipstick. You puff your hair, pack your business cards, and youre off. Whoa! Wait a minute. Didnt you forget the most important thing? What about the right conversation to enhance your image? Are you actually going to say anything that comes to mindor doesntat the moment? You wouldnt don the first outfit your groping hand hits in the darkened closet, so you shouldnt leave your conversing to the first thought that comes to mind when faing a group of expectant, smiling faces. You will, of course, folow your instincts in conversation. But at least be prepared in case inspiration doesnt hit. The best way to ensure youre conversationally in the swing of things is to listen to a newscast just before you leave. Whats hapening right now in the worldall the fires, floods, air disasters, toppled governments, and stock market crashespulverizes into great conversational fodder, no matter what crowd youre circlating in. It is with some embarrassment that I must attribute the folowing technique to a businesswoman in the worlds oldest prfession. For a magazine article I was writing, I interviewed one of the savviest operators in her field, Sidney Biddle Barrows, the famed Mayflower Madam. Sidney told me she had a house rule when she was in business. All of her female independent contractors were directed to keep up with the daily news so they could be good conversationalists with their clients. This was not just Sidneys whim. Feedback from her employees had revealed that 60 percent of her girls work hour was spent in chatting and only 40 percent in satisfying the cutomers needs. Thus she instructed them to read the daily newpaper or listen to a radio broadcast before leaving for an Technique #23 The Latest News . . . Dont Leave Home Without It The last move to make before leaving for the party even after youve given yourself final approval in the mirroris to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybodys talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when its surrounded by egg-on-face. How to Always Have Something Interesting to Say 91 appointment. Sidney told me when she initiated this rule, her busness increased significantly. Reports came back from her clients complimenting her on the fascinating women she had working for her. The consummate businesswoman, Ms. Barrows always strove to exceed her customers expectations. Ready for the big leagues of conversation? Lets go.",

        "text": "PART THREE How to Talk Like a VIP Welcome to the human jungle. When two tigers prowling through the jungle chance upon one another in a clearing, they look at each other. They freeze. Instinctively they calculate, If our staring came to hissingcame to scratchingcame to clawingwho would win? Which of us has the stronger survival skills? Tigers in the wilderness differ little from the urban upright animals inhabiting the corporate jungle (or singles jungle or social jungle). Humans start the process by looking at each other and talking. In the business world, while smiling and uttering How do you do? Hello, Howdy, or Hi, they are, like tigers, instinctively, instantaneously, sizing each other up. Theyre not calculating the length of each others claws or the sharpness of their teeth. Theyre judging each other on a weapon far more powerful to survival as they have defined it. Humans are judging each others communications skills. Although they may not know the names of the specific studies first proving it, they sense the truth: 85 percent of ones success in life is directly due to communications skills. 13 They may not be familiar with the U.S. Census Bureaus recent survey showing employers choose candidates with good communications skills and attitude way over education, experience, and training.But they know communications skills get peple to the top. Thus, by observing each other carefully during casual conversing, it becomes almost immediately evident to both which is the bigger cat in the human jungle. It doesnt take long for people to recognize who is an impotant person. One clichŽ, one insensitive remark, one overanxious reaction, and you can be professionally or personally demoted. You can lose a potentially important friendship or business contact. One stupid move and you can tumble off the corporate or social ladder. The techniques in this section will help ensure that you make all the right moves so this doesnt happen. The following comunications skills give you a leg up to start your ascent to the top of any ladder you choose. How to Find Out What They Do (Without Even Asking!) To size each other up, the first question little cats flat-pawedly ask each other is, And what do you do? Hmm? Then they crouch there, quivering their whiskers and twitching their noses, with an obvious Im going to pronounce silent judgment on you after you answer look on their pusses. Big cats never ask outright, What do you do? (Oh they find out, all right, in a much more subtle manner.) By not asking the question, the big boys and big girls come across as more princpled, even spiritual. After all, their silence says, a man or woman is far more than his or her job. Resisting the tempting question also shows their sensitivity. With so much downsizing, rightsizing, and capsizing of corportions these days, the blunt interrogation evokes uneasiness. The job question is not just unpleasant for those who are between engagements. I have several gainfully employed friends who hate being asked, And what do you do? (One of these folks cuts cadavers for autopsies, the other is an IRS collection agent.) Additionally, millions of talented and accomplished women have chosen to devote themselves to motherhood. When the cruel corporate question is thrust at them, they feel guilty. The rude interrogation belittles their commitment to their families. No matter how the women answer, they fear the asker is only going to hear a humble Im just a housewife. Big boys and big girls should avoid asking, What do you do? for another reason: their abstinence from the question leads liteners to believe that they are in the habit of soaring with a higflying crowd. Recently I attended a posh party on Easy Street. (I suspect they invited me as their token working-class person.) I noticed no one was asking anyone what they didbecause these swells didnt do anything. Oh, some might have a ticker tape on the bed table of their mansion to track investments. But they deinitely did not work for a living. The final benefit to not asking, What do you do? is it throws people off guard. It convinces them you are enjoying their copany for who they are, not for any crass networking reason. The Right Way to Find Out So how do you find out what someone does for a living? (I thought youd never ask.) You simply practice the following eight words. All together now: How . . . do . . . you . . . spend . . . most . . . of ...your...time? Technique #24 What Do You DoNOT! A sure sign youre a Somebody is the conspicuous asence of the question, What do you do? (You detemine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber, a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone whos never strolled along Easy Street.) How to Find Out What They Do (Without Even Asking!) 97 How do you spend most of your time? is the gracious way to let a cadaver cutter, a tax collector, or a capsized employee off the hook. Its the way to reinforce an accomplished mothers choice. Its the way to assure a spiritual soul you see his or her inner beauty. Its a way to suggest to a swell that you reside on Easy Street, too. Now, suppose youve just made the acquaintance of someone who does like to talk about his or her work? Asking, How do you spend most of your time? also opens the door for workaholics to spout off, Oh golly, they mock moan, I just spend all my time working. That, of course, is your invitation to grill them for details. (Then theyll talk your ear off.) Yet the new wording of your question gives those who are somewhere between at leisure and work addicted the choice of telling you about their job or not. Finally, asking How do you spend most of your time? instead of And what do you do? gives you your big cat stripes right off. How to Know What to Say When They Ask, What Do You Do? Now, 99 percent of the people you meet will, of course, ask And what do you do? Big winners, realizing someone will always ask, are fully prepared for the interrogation. Many folks have one written rŽsumŽ for job seeking. They type it up and then trudge off to the printer to get a nice neat stack to send to all prospective employers. The rŽsumŽ lists their previous positions, dates of employment, and education. Then, at the bottom, they might as well have scribbled, Well, thats me. Take it or leave it. And usually they get left. Why? Because prspective employers do not find enough specific points in the rŽsumŽ that relate directly to what their firm is seeking. Boys and girls in the big leagues, however, have bits and bytes of their entire work experience tucked away in their computers. When applying for a job, they punch up only the appropriate data and print it out so it looks like it just came from the printer. My friend Roberto was out of work last year. He applied for two positions:a sales manager of an ice cream company and head of strategic planning for a fast-food chain. He did extensive research and found the ice cream company had deep sales diffculties and the food chain had long-range international aspirations. How to Know What to Say When They Ask, What Do You Do? 99 Did he send the same rŽsumŽ to each? Absolutely not. His rŽsumŽ never deviated one iota from the truth of his background. Hoever, for the ice cream company, he highlighted his experience turning a small company around by doubling its sales in three years. For the food chain, he underscored his experience working in Europe and his knowledge of foreign markets. Both firms offered Roberto the job. Now he could play them off against each other. He went to each, explaining hed like to work for them but another firm was offering a higher salary or more perks. The two firms started bidding against each other for Roberto. He finally chose the food chain at almost double the salary they originally offered him. To make the most of every encounter, personalize your verbal rŽsumŽ with just as much care as you would your written curiculum vitae. Instead of having one answer to the omnipresent What do you do? prepare a dozen or so variations, depending on whos asking. For optimum networking, every time someone asks about your job, give a calculated oral rŽsumŽ in a nutshell. Before you submit your answer, consider what possible interest the asker could have in you and your work. Heres How My Life Can Benefit Yours Top salespeople talk extensively of the benefit statement. They know, when talking with a potential client, they should open their conversation with a benefit statement. When my colleague Brian makes cold calls, instead of saying Hello, my name is Brian Tracy. Im a sales trainer, he says, Hello, my name is Brian Tracy from the Institute for Executive Development. Would you be interested in a proven method that can increase your sales from 20 to 30 pecent over the next twelve months? That is his benefit statement. He highlights the specific benefits of what he has to offer to his prospect. My hairdresser Gloria, I discovered, gives a terrific benefit statement to everyone she meets. Thats probably why she has so many clients. In fact, thats how she got me as a client. When I met Gloria at a convention, she told me she was a hairdresser who specialized in flexible hairstyles for the businesswoman. She casally mentioned she has many clients who choose a conservative hairstyle for work that they can instantly convert to a feminine style for social situations. Hey, thats me, I said to myself, figering my stringy little ponytail. I asked for her card and Gloria became my hairdresser. Then, several months later, I happened to see Gloria at another event. I overheard her chatting with a stylish grey-haired woman at the buffet table. Gloria was saying . . . and we specialize in a wonderful array of blue rinses. Now that was news to me! I didnt remember seeing one grey head in her salon. As I was leaving the party, Gloria was out on the lawn talking animatedly with the hosts teenage daughters. Oh yeah, she was saying, like we specialize in these really cool up-to-the-minute styles. Good for you, Gloria! Like Gloria the hairdresser, give your response a once-over before answering the inevitable What do you do? When somone asks, never give just a one-word answer. Thats for forms. If business networking is on your mind, ask yourself, How could my professional experience benefit this persons life? For example, here are some descriptions various people might put on their tax return: Real estate agent Financial planner Martial arts instructor Cosmetic surgeon Hairdresser How to Know What to Say When They Ask, What Do You Do? 101 Any practitioner of the above professions should reflect on the benefit his or her job has to humankind. (Every job has some beefit or you wouldnt get paid to do it.) The advice to the folks above is Dont say real estate agent. Say I help people moving into our area find the right home. Dont say financial planner. Say I help people plan their financial future. Dont say martial arts instructor. Say I help people defend themselves by teaching martial arts. Dont say cosmetic surgeon. Say I reconstruct peoples faces after disfiguring accidents. (Or, if youre talking with a woman of a certain age, as the French so gracefully say, tell her, I help people to look as young as they feel through cometic surgery.) Dont say hairdresser. Say I help a woman find the right hairstyle for her particular face. (Go, Gloria!) Putting the benefit statement in your verbal Nutshell RŽsumŽ brings your job to life and makes it memorable. Even if your new acquaintance cant use your services, the next time he or she meets someone moving into the area, wanting to plan their financial future, thinking of self defense, considering cosmetic sugery, or needing a new hairstyle, who comes to mind? Not the unimaginative people who gave the tax-return description of their jobs, but the big winners who painted a picture of helping people with needs. A Nutshell RŽsumŽ for Your Private Life The Nutshell RŽsumŽ works in nonbusiness situations, too. Since the new acquaintances will always ask you about yourself, prepare a few exciting stock answers. When meeting a potential friend or loved one, make your life sound like you will be a fun person to know. As a young girl, I wrote novels in my mind about my life. Leil, squinting her eyes against the torrential downpour, bravely reached out the window into the icy storm to pull the shutters tight and keep the family safe from the approaching hurricane. Big dealMama asked me to close the windows when it started to rain. Still, marching toward the open window, I fancied myself the familys brave savior. You dont need to be quite so melodramatic in your self-image, but at least punch up your life to sound interesting and dedicated. Technique #25 The Nutshell RŽsumŽ Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written rŽsumŽ off their printers for each position theyre applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to What do you do? ask yourself, What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy? Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to work into your communications bag of tricks. How to Sound Even Smarter Than You Are Did you ever hear someone try to say a word that was just too darn big for his tongue? By the smile on the speakers face and the gleam in his eye as the word limped off his lips, you knew he was really proud of it. (To make matters worse, he probably used the word incorrectly, inappropriately, and maybe even mispronounced it. Ouch.) The world perceives people with rich vocabularies to be more creative, more intelligent. People with larger vocabularies get hired quicker, promoted faster, and listened to a whole lot more. So big winners use rich, full words, but they never sound inappropriate. The phrases slide gracefully off their tongues to enrich their coversation. The words fit. With the care that they choose their tie or their blouse, big players in life choose words to match their pesonalities and their points. The startling good news is that the difference between a respected vocabulary and a mundane one is only about fifty words! You dont need much to sound like a big winner. A mere few dozen wonderful words will give everyone the impression that you have an original and creative mind. Acquiring this super vocabulary is easy. You neednt pore over vocabulary books or listen to tapes of pompous pontificators with 103 impossible British accents. You dont need to learn two-dollar words that your grandmother, if she heard, would wash out of your mouth with soap. All you need to do is think of a few tired, overworked words you use every daywords like smart, nice, pretty, or good. Then grab a thesaurus or book of synonyms off the shelf. Look up that common word even you are bored hearing yourself utter every day. Examine your long list of alternatives. For example, if you turn to the word smart, youll find dozens of synonyms. Some words are colorful and rich like ingenious, resourceful, adroit, shrewd, and many more. Run down the list and say each out loud. Which ones fit your personality? Which ones seem right for you? Try each on like a suit of clothes to see which feel comfortable. Choose a few favorites and practice saying them aloud until they become a natural staple of your vocabulary. The next time you want to compliment someone on being smart, say, youll be purring Oh, that was so clever of you. My how resourceful. That was ingenious. Or maybe, How astute of you. And Now, for Men Only Gentlemen, we women spend a lot of time in front of the mirror (as if you didnt know). When I was in college, it used to take me a full fifteen minutes to fix myself up for a date. Every year since, Ive had to add a few minutes. Im now up to an hour and a half gussying myself up for an evening out. Gentlemen, when your wife comes down the staircase all dolled up for a night out, or you pick a lady up for dinner, what do you say? If you make no comment except, Well, are you ready to go? how do you think that makes the lady feel? How to Sound Even Smarter Than You Are 105 My friend Gary is a nice gentleman and he occasionally takes me to dinner. I met him about twelve years ago, and Ill never foget the first time he arrived on my doorstep for our date. He said, Leil, you look great. I adored his reaction! I saw Gary a month or so later. On my doorstep again, Leil, you look great. The precise same words as the first time, but I still appreciated it. Its been twelve long years now that this gentleman and I have been friends. I see him about once every two months, and every darn time its the same old comment, Leil, you look great. (I think Ill show up one evening in a flannel nightshirt and a mud pack on my face. I swear Gary will say, Leil, you look great.) During my seminars, to help men avoid Garys mistake, I ask every male to think of a synonym for pretty or great. Then I bring up one woman and several men. I ask each to pretend he is her husband. She has just come down the stairs ready to go out to diner. I ask each to take her hand and deliver his compliment. Darla, one says, you look elegant. Ooh! Every woman in the room sighs. Darla, says another, taking her hand, you look stunning. Ooh! Every woman in the room swoons. Darla, says the third, putting her hand between his, you look ravishing. Ooooh! By now every woman in the room has gone limp. Pay attention men! Words work on us women. More Unisex Suggestions Suppose youve been at a party and it was wonderful. Dont tell the hosts it was wonderful. Everybody says that. Tell them it was a splendid party, a superb party, an extraordinary party. Hug the hosts and tell them you had a magnificent time, a remarkable time, a glorious time. The first few times you say a word like glorious, it may not roll comfortably off your tongue. Yet you have no trouble with the word wonderful. Hmm, glor-i-ous doesnt have any more syllables than won-der-ful. Neither does it have any more difficult sounds to pronounce. Vocabulary is all a matter of familiarity. Use your new favorite words a few times and, just like breaking in a new pair of shoes, youll be very comfortable wearing your glorious new words. Technique #26 Your Personal Thesaurus Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements. Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and youll be in the verbally elite. How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity) Tigers prowl with tigers; lions lurk with lions; and little alley cats scramble around with other little alley cats. Similarity breeds attraction. But in the human jungle, big cats know a secret. When you delay revealing your similarity, or let them discover it, it has much more punch. Above all, you dont want to sound anxious to have rapport. Whenever someone mentions a common interest or experence, instead of jumping in with a breathless, Hey, me, too! I do that, too or I know all about that, let your conversation parner enjoy talking about it. Let her go on about the country club before you tell her youre a member, too. Let him go on analyzing the golf swing of Arnold Palmer before you start casually coparing the swings of golf greats Greg, Jack, Tiger, and Arnie. Let her tell you how many tennis games shes won before you just hapen to mention your USTA ranking. Several years ago, I was telling a new acquaintance how much I love to ski. He listened with interest as I indulged in a detailed travelogue of places Id skied. I raved about the various resorts. I analyzed the various conditions. I discussed artificial versus nat ral snow. It wasnt until near the end of my monologue that I 107 finally had the sense to ask my new acquaintance if he skied. He replied, Yes, I keep a little apartment in Aspen. Cool! If hed jumped in and told me about his ski pad right after I first told him how much I liked skiing, Id have been impressed. Mildly. However, waiting until the end of our convesationand then revealing he was such an avid skier that he kept an Aspen ski padmade it unforgettable. Heres the technique I call Kill the Quick Me, Too! Wheever people mention an activity or interest you share, let them enjoy discussing their passion. Then, when the time is right, casally mention you share their interest. Oh, I Must Have Been Boring You I waited weeks for the opportunity to try it out. Finally the moment presented itself at a convention. A new contact began telling me about her recent trip to Washington, D.C. (She had no idea that Washington was where I grew up.) She told me all about the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Kennedy Center, and how she and her husband went bicycling in Rock Creek Park. (Momentarily I forgot I was keeping my mouth shut to practice my new technique. I was genuinely enjoying hearing about these familiar sights from a visitors perspective.) I asked her where she stayed, where she dined, and if she had a chance to get into any of the beautiful Maryland or Virginia suurbs. At one point, obviously pleased by my interest in her trip, she said, You sound like you know a lot about Washington. Yes, I replied. Its my hometown, but I havent been back there in ages. Your hometown! she squealed. My goodness, why didnt you tell me? I must have been boring you. Oh, not at all, I replied honestly. I was enjoying hearing about your trip so much, I was afraid youd stop if I told you. Her How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity) 109 big smile and barely audible Oh gosh let me know I had won a new friend. When someone starts telling you about an activity he has done, a trip she has made, a club he belongs to, an interest she hasanything that you sharebite your tongue. Let the teller relish his or her own monologue. Relax and enjoy it, too, secretly knowing how much pleasure your conversation partner will have when you reveal you share the same experience. Then, when the moment is ripe, casually disclose your similarity. And be sure to mention how much you enjoyed hearing about his or her shared interest. Technique #27 Kill the Quick Me, Too! Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger. P.S.: Dont wait too long to reveal your shared interest or it will seem like youre being tricky. HowtoBeaYoFirstie to Gain Their Respect and Affection SEX! Now that I have your attention. . . . Two-bit comics have been using that gag from the days when two bits bought a foursquare meal. However, big winners know theres a three-letter word more potent then SEX to get peoples attention. That word is YOU. Why is you such a powerful word? Because when we were infants, we thought we were the center of the universe. Nothing mattered but ME, MYSELF, and I. The rest of the shadowy forms stirring about us (which we later learned were other people) existed solely for what they could do for us. Self-centered little tykes that we were, our tiny brains translated every action, every word, into, How does that affect ME? Big winners know we havent changed a bit. Adults camouflage their self-centeredness under a mask of civilization and politeness. Yet the human brain still immediately, instinctively, and unfailingly translates everything into terms of How does that affect ME? For example, suppose, gentlemen, you want to ask a colleague, Jill, if she would like to join you for dinner. So you say to her, Theres a really good new Indian restaurant in town. Will you join me there for dinner tonight? 110 How to Be a You-Firstie to Gain Their Respect and Af fection 111 Before answering, Jill is thinking to herself, By good does he mean the food or the atmosphere or both? Her reverie cotinues, Indian cuisine, Im not sure. He says its good. However, will I like it? While thinking, Jill hesitates. You probably take her hesitation personally, and the joy of the exchange diminishes. Suppose, instead, you had said to her, Jill, you will really love this new Indian restaurant. Will you join me there this evening for dinner? Phrasing it that way, youve already subliminally answered Jills questions and shes more apt to give you a quick yes. The pleasure-pain principle is a guiding force in life. Pschologists tell us everyone automatically gravitates toward that which is pleasurable and pulls away from that which is painful. For many people, thinking is painful. So big winners (when they wish to control, inspire, be loved by, sell to people, or get them to go to dinner) do the thinking for them. They translate everything into the other persons terms by starting as many sentences as they can with that powerful little three-letter word, you. Thus, I call the technique Comm-YOU-nication. Comm-YOU-nicate When You Want a Favor Putting you first gets a much better response, especially when youre asking a favor, because it pushes the askers pride button. Suppose you want to take a long weekend. You decide to ask your boss if you can take Friday off. Which request do you think he or she is going to react to more positively? Can I take Friday off, Boss? Or this one: Boss, can you do without me Friday? In the first case, Boss had to translate your Can I take Friday off ? into Can I do without this employee Friday? Thats an extra thought process. (And you know how some bosses hate to think!) However, in the second case, Boss, can you do without me Friday, you did Bosss thinking for her. Your new wording made managing without you a matter of pride for Boss. Of course, she said to herself. I can manage without your help Friday. Comm-YOU-nicate Your Compliments Comm-YOU-nication also enriches your social conversation. Getlemen, say a lady likes your suit. Which woman gives you warmer feelings? The woman who says, I like your suit. Or the one who says, You look great in that suit. Big players who make business presentations use ComYOU-nication to excellent advantage. Suppose youre giving a talk and a participant asks a question. He likes to hear you say, Thats a good question. However, consider how much better he feels when you tell him, Youve asked a good question. Salespeople, dont just tell your prospects, Its important that . . . . Convince them by informing them, Youll see the impotance of. . . . When negotiating, instead of, The result will be . . . let them know, Youll see the result when you. . . . Starting sentences with you even works when talking to strangers on the street. Once, driving around San Francisco hoplessly lost, I asked people walking along the sidewalk how to get to the Golden Gate Bridge. I stopped a couple trudging up a hill. Excuse me, I called out the window, I cant find the Golden Gate Bridge. The pair looked at each other and shrugged with that How stupid can these tourists get look on their faces. That direction, the husband mumbled, pointing straight ahead. Still lost, I called out to the next couple I encountered. Excuse me, wheres the Golden Gate Bridge? Without smiling, they pointed in the opposite direction. How to Be a You-Firstie to Gain Their Respect and Af fection 113 Then I decided to try Comm-YOU-nication. When I came upon the next strolling couple, I called out the window, Excuse me, could you tell me where the Golden Gate Bridge is? Of course, they said, answering my question literally. You see, by phrasing the question that way, it was a subtle challenge. I was asking, in essence, Are you able to give me directions? This hits them in the pride button. They walked over to my car and gave me explicit instructions. Hey, I thought. This you stuff really works. To test my hypothesis, I tried it a few more times. I kept asking passersby my three forms of the question. Sure enough, whenever I asked, Could you tell me where . . . people were more pleasant and helful than when I started the question with I or where. Im sure when they recover the flight box from the Fall of Man under a fig leaf in the Garden of Eden, it will convince the world of the power of the word you. Eve did not ask Adam to eat the apple. She did not command him to eat the apple. She didnt even Technique #28 Comm-YOU-nication Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immedately grabs your listeners attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into me terms. When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice. say, Adam, I want you to eat this apple. She phrased it (as all big winners would), You will love this apple. Thats why he bit. Comm-YOU-nication Is a Sign of Sanity Therapists calculate inmates of mental institutions say I and me twelve times more often than residents of the outside world. As patients conditions improve, the number of times they use the personal pronouns also diminishes. Continuing up the sanity scale, the fewer times you use I, the more sane you seem to your listeners. If you eavesdrop on big winers talking with each other, youll notice a lot more you than I in their conversation. The next technique concerns a way big winners are silently you-oriented. How to Make Them Feel You Dont Smile at Just Anybody Have you ever seen those low-budget, mail-order fashion catlogues that use the same model throughout? Whether she is engulfed in a wedding gown or partially clad in a bikini, her face sports the same plastic smile. Looking at her, you get the feeling if you rapped on her forehead, a tiny voice would come back saing Nobodys in here. Whereas models in more sophisticated magazines have matered a myriad of different expressions: a flirtatious Ive got a secret smile on one page; a quizzical I think Id like to get to know you but Im not sure smile on the next; and a mysterious Mona Lisa smile on the third. You feel theres a brain running the operation somewhere inside that beautiful head. I once stood in the receiving line of the ship I worked on, along with the captain, his wife, and several other officers. One passenger with a radiant smile started shaking hands down our line. When he got to me, he flashed a shimmering smile, reveaing teeth as even and white as keys on a new piano. I was tranfixed. It was as though a brilliant light had illuminated the dim ballroom. I wished him a happy cruise and resolved to find this charming gentleman later. 115 Then he was introduced to the next person. Out of the coner of my eye, I saw his identical glistening grin. A third person, the same grin. My interest began to dwindle. When he gave his fourth indistinguishable smile to the next person, he started to resemble a Cheshire cat. By the time he was introduced to the fifth person, his consistent smile felt like a strobe light disturbing the ambience of the ballroom. Strobe Man went on flashing everybody the same smile down the line. I had no futher interest in talking with him. Why did this mans stock shoot high in my ticker one minute and plummet the next? Because his smile, although charming, reflected no special reaction to me. Obviously, he gave the same smile to everybody and, by that, it lost all its specialness. If Strobe Man had given each of us a slightly different smile, he would have appeared sensitive and insightful. (Of course, if his smile had been just a tad bigger for me than for the others, I couldnt have waited for the formalities to be over to seek him out in the crowded ballroom.) Review Your Repertoire of Smiles If your job required you to carry a gun, you would, of course, learn all about the moving parts before firing it. And before taking aim, you would carefully consider whether it would murder, maim, or merely wound your target. Since your smile is one of your biggest communications weapons, learn all about the moving parts and the effect on your target. Set aside five minutes. Lock your bedroom or bathroom door so your family doesnt think youve gone off the deep end. Now stand in front of the mirror and flash a few smiles. Discover the subtle differences in your repertoire. Just as you would alternate saying Hello, How do you do, and I am pleased to meet you when being introduced to a group How to Make Them Feel You Dont Smile at Just Anybody 117 of people, vary your smile. Dont use the same on each. Let each of your smiles reflect the nuances of your sentiment about the recipient. In Defense of the Quickie There are times, I discovered, when the quick put-on smile works. For example, when you want to engineer the acquaintance of someone to whom you have not had the opportunity to be intrduced. (In the vernacular, thats pick them up.) The smiles pickup power was proven for posterity by solemn researchers at the University of Missouri. They conducted a highly controlled study titled Giving Men the Come-On: Effect of Eye Contact and Smiling in a Bar Environment.(I kid you not.) To prove their hypothesis, female researchers made eye contact with unsuspecting male subjects enjoying a little libation in a local drinking establishment. Sometimes, the female researchers folowed their glance with a smile. In other cases, no smile. Technique #29 The Exclusive Smile If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confeerate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty big players find in each new face. If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her. The results? I quote the study: The highest approach behaior, 60 percent, was observed in the condition in which there was smiling. That translates into laymans English: The guy came over 60 percent of the time when the lady smiled. Without the smile, he made the approach only 20 percent of the time. So, yes, a smile works for those who wish to pick somebody up. However, in situations where the stakes are higher, try The Flooding Smile from the first section and now The Exclusive Smile. How to Avoid Sounding Like a Jerk Do you remember that scene from the movie classic Annie Hall where Diane Keaton is first meeting Woody Allen? As shes chating with him, we hear her private thoughts. Shes musing to heself, Oh I hope hes not a jerk like all the others. One of the quickest ways to make a big winner think you are, well, a jerk, is to use a clichŽ. If youre chatting with a top comunicator and even innocently remark Yes, I was tired as a dog, or She was cute as a button, youve unknowingly laid a linguitic bomb. Big winners silently moan when they hear someone mouth a trite overworn phrase. Oh sure, just like the rest of us, big winers find themselves feeling fit as a fiddle, happy as a lark, or high as a kite. Like the rest of humanity, they consider some of their acquaintances crazy as a loon, nutty as a fruitcake, or blind as a bat. Because many of them work hard, many of them are as busy as a bee and get rich as Croesus. Yet would any of them describe themselves in those words? Not in a coons age! Why? Because when a big winner hears your clichŽ, you might as well be saying, My powers of imagination are impoverished. I cant think of anything original to say, so I must fall back on these trite overworn phrases. Mouthing a com119 mon clichŽ around uncommonly successful people brands you as uncommonly common. Technique #30 Dont Touch a ClichŽ with a Ten-Foot Pole Be on guard. Dont use any clichŽs when chatting with big winners. Dont even touch one with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob. Instead of coughing up a clichŽ, roll your own clever phrases by using the next technique. How to Use Motivational Speakers Techniques to Enhance Your Conversation They say the pen is mightier than the sword. It is, but the tongue is even mightier than the pen. Our tongues can bring crowds to laughter, to tears, and often to their feet in shouting appreciation. Orators have moved nations to war or brought lost souls to God. And what is their equipment? The same eyes, ears, hands, legs, arms, and vocal chords you and I have. Perhaps a professional athlete has a stronger body or a profesional singer is blessed with a more beautiful singing voice than the one we were doled out. But the professional speaker starts out with the same equipment we all have. The difference is, these ja smiths use it all. They use their hands, they use their bodies, and they use specific gestures with heavy impact. They think about the space theyre talking in. They employ many different tones of voice, they invoke various expressions, they vary the speed with which they speak . . . and they make effective use of silence. You may not have to make a formal speech anytime soon, but chances are sometime (probably very soon) youre going to want 121 people to see things your way. Whether its persuading your faily to spend their next vacation at Grandmas, or convincing the stockholders in your multimillion-dollar corporation that its time to do a takeover, do it like a pro. Get a book or two on public speaking and learn some of the tricks of the trade. Then put some of that drama into your everyday conversation. A Gem for Every Occasion If stirring words help make your point, ponder the impact of poerful phrases. Theyve helped politicians get elected (Read my lips: no new taxes.) and defendants get acquitted (If it doesnt fit, you must acquit.). If George H. W. Bush had said, I promise not to raise taxes, or Johnny Cochran, during O. J. Simpsons criminal trial, had said, If the glove doesnt fit, he must be innocent, their bulky setences would have slipped in and out of the voters or jurors cosciousness. As every politician and trial lawyer knows, neat phrases make powerful weapons. (If youre not careful, your enemies will later use them against youread my lips!) One of my favorite speakers is a radio broadcaster named Barry Farber who brightens up late-night radio with sparkling siiles. Barry would never use a clichŽ like nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof. Hed describe being nervous about losing his job as I felt like an elephant dangling over a cliff with his tail tied to a daisy. Instead of saying he looked at a pretty woman, hed say, My eyeballs popped out and dangled by the optic nerve. When I first met him, I asked, Mr. Farber, how do you come up with these phrases? My daddys Mr. Farber. Im Barry, he chided (his way of saing, Call me Barry). He then candidly admitted, although some of his phrases are original, many are borrowed. (Elvis Presley used How to Use Motivational Speakers Techniques to Enhance Your Conversation 123 to say, My daddys Mr. Presley. Call me Elvis.) Like all profesional speakers, Barry spends several hours a week gleaning through books of quotations and humor. All professional speakers do. They collect bon mots they can use in a variety of situations most especially to scrape egg off their faces when something unepected happens. Many speakers use authors and speakers agent Lilly Walterss face-saver lines from her book, What to Say When Youre Dying on the Platform.If you tell a joke and no one laughs, try That joke was designed to get a silent laughand it worked. If the micrphone lets out an agonizing howl, look at it and say, I dont undestand. I brushed my teeth this morning. If someone asks you a question you dont want to answer, Could you save that question until Im finishedand well on my way home? All pros think of holes they might fall into and then memorize great escape lines. You can do the same. Look through books of similes to enrich your day-to-day coversations. Instead of happy as a lark try happy as a lottery winer or happy as a baby with its first ice cream cone. Instead of bald as an eagle, try bald as a new marine or bald as a bulfrogs belly. Instead of quiet as a mouse, try quiet as an eel swimming in oil or quiet as a fly lighting on a feather duster. Find phrases that have visual impact. Instead of a clichŽ like sure as death and taxes, try as certain as beach traffic in July or as sure as your shadow will follow you. Your listeners cant see death or taxes. But they sure can see beach traffic in July or their shadow following them down the street. Try to make your similes relate to the situation. If youre riing in a taxi with someone, as sure as that taxi meter will rise has immediate impact. If youre talking with a man walking his dog, as sure as your dog is thinking about that tree adds a touch of humor. Make Em Laugh, Make Em Laugh, Make Em Laugh Humor enriches any conversation. But not jokes starting with, Hey didja hear the one about . . . ? Plan your humor and make it relevant. For example, if youre going to a meeting on the buget, look up money in a quotation book. In an uptight business situation, a little levity shows youre at ease. Once, during an oppressive financial meeting, I heard a top executive say, Dont worry, this company has enough money to stay in business for yearsunless we pay our creditors. He broke the tension and won the appreciation of all. Later I saw a similar quote in a humor book attributed to Jackie Mason, the comedian. So what? The exec still came across as a cool communicator with his clever comment. Big players who want to be quoted in the media lie awake at night gnawing the pillow trying to come up with phrases the press will pick up. A Michigan veterinarian named Timothy, a heavy hitter in his own field but completely unknown outside it, made national headlines when he planned to attach a pair of feet to a rooster who lost his to frostbite. Why? Because he called it a drumstick transplant. I dont know if a French woman, Jeanne Calment, then offcially the worlds oldest person, was looking for publicity on her 122nd birthday. But she made international headlines when she told the media, Ive only ever had one wrinkle, and Im sitting on it. Mark Victor Hansen, a big player in his own field but once reatively unknown outside of it, was propelled into national promnence when he came up with a catchy name for his book coauthored with Jack Canfield, Chicken Soup for the Soul. He told me his original title was 101 Pretty Stories. How far would that have gone? Soon the world was lapping up, among others, his Chicken How to Use Motivational Speakers Techniques to Enhance Your Conversation 125 Soup for the Womans Soul, Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul, Chicken Soup for the Mothers Soul, Chicken Soup for the Christian Soul, plus second, third, and fourth servings of chicken soup in hardcover, paperback, audiocassette, videocassette, and calendars. A Word of Warning No matter how good your material is, it bombs if it doesnt fit the situation. I learned this the hard way during my cruise ship days. On a cruise to England I decided to give my passengers a reading of the English love poems of Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browing. You know, How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. It was a BIG hit. The passengers loved it and raved for days. I couldnt walk out on deck without some passenger turning to me and affectionately echoing, How do I love thee? Technique #31 Use Jawsmiths Jive Whether youre standing behind a podium facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, youll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills. Read speakers books to cull quotations, pull pearls of wisdom, and get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make em rhyme, make em clever, or make em funny. Above all, make em relevant. Naturally I got a pretty swollen head over this performance and fancied myself an eminent poetry reader. I decided to reward the passengers on the next cruise (which was a cruise to the Caribbean and didnt go anywhere in the neighborhood of England) with my spectacular reading of the English love poems. WHAT A BOMB! Passengers avoided me on the deck for the rest of the cruise. How did you bore me? Let me count the ways. How to Banter Like the Big Shots Do (Big Winners Tell It Like It Is) If you stepped into an elevator full of people speaking Hungaian, you might not recognize they were Hungarian unless you spoke their language. However, the minute you opened your mouth, theyd recognize youre not Hungarian. Its the same with the big cats. If you overhear several of them speaking, you might not recognize theyre big cats. However, the minute you opened your mouth theyd recognize youre not a big cat, unless you spoke their lingo. What are some differences between a big cats growl and a litle cats insignificant hiss? One of the most blatant is euphemisms. Big cats arent afraid of real words. They call a spade a spade. Words like toilet paper dont scare them. Little cats hide behind bathroom tissue. If somebody is rich, big cats call it rich. Little cats, oh so embarrassed at the concept of talking about money in polite company, substitute the word wealthy. When little cats use a substitute word or euphemism, they might as well be saying, Whoops, you are better than I am. Im in polite company now and so Ill use the nicey-nice word. Big cats are anatomically correctno cutesy words for body parts. Theyll say breasts when they mean breasts. When they 127 say knockers, they mean decorative structures that hang on the front door. And family jewels are in the safe on the wall. If a big cat is ever in doubt about a word, he or she simply resorts to French. If they feel the word buttocks is debatable, deriere will do quite nicely, thank you. Technique #32 Call a Spade a Spade Dont hide behind euphemisms. Call a spade a spade. That doesnt mean big cats use tasteless four-letter words when perfectly decent fivand six-letter ones exist. Theyve simply learned the Kings English, and they speak it. Heres another way to tell the big players from the little ones just by listening to a few minutes of their conversation. How to Avoid the Worlds Worst Conversational Habit Once I was at a small dinner party given by the president of an advertising agency, Louis, and his wife, Lillian. The evening started with cocktails, followed by a gourmet meal accompanied by a selection of excellent wines. The conversation had been covivial, the cuisine delicious, and the wine very fine. And very pletiful. At the end of the evening, Louis raised his glass to make a toast. A few wine droplets sloshed out of his glass onto the tablecloth. A pretty young woman who was the date of a new art diretor named Bob giggled and said, I can tell youre feeling no pain. Shock waves went around the table. Everyone froze. The host was indeed a bit inebriated. However, alluding to Louis being a little looped, even in jest, was as though the woman had suddenly smashed the crystal chandelier above the table with her dinner plate. One guest quickly covered the girls horrifying gaffe by lifting her glass and saying None of us is. No one in the company of Louis and Lillian could ever feel any pain. Heres to a truly woderful evening. Louis then continued with his toast to the wonderful copany, and no one was feeling pain any longer. Except Bob. He 129 knew his dates innocent teasing was a black mark, if not in his personnel file, on his personal file. The next sure sign of a little cathood is teasing. Little cats go around patting their friends paunches and saying, Enjoying that cheesecake, huh? Or looking at their balding heads and saying, Hey, hair today, gone tomorrow, huh? They think its hilarious to make a quip at someone elses expense and say You dont have an inferiority complex. You are inferior! Hardy har har. Technique #33 Trash the Teasing A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone elses expense may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have the last one. Because youll bang your head against the glass ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their paws. Never, ever, make a joke at anyone elses expense. Youll wind up paying for it, dearly. How to Give Them the Bad News (and Have Them Like You All the More) In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the humblest message runer like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was chopped off. Shades of that spirit pervade todays conversations. Once a friend and I packed up some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for an outing. As we waltzed happily out the door, picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor, rocking away on his porch, looked up at the sky and said, Oh boy, bad day for a picnic. The newcast says its going to rain. I wanted to rub his face in my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Not for his gloomy weather report, for his smile. Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus. As I breatlessly shoved my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the grinning sales agent gushed, Oh that bus left five minutes ago. Dreams of decapitation! Its not the news that makes someone angry. Its the unsypathetic attitude with which its delivered. Everyone must give bad 131 news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient she needs an opertion does it with compassion. A boss informing an employee he didnt get the job takes on a sympathetic demeanor. Grief couselors at airports after fatal crashes share the grief-stricken sentment of relatives. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the sentiment of the receiver. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this sensitivity. When youre weary from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully chirped that your room isnt ready yet? When you had your heart set on the roast beef, has your waiter merrily warbled that he just served the last piece? When you needed cash for the weekend, has your bank teller gleefully told you your account is overdrawn? It makes you as traveler, diner, or depositor want to put your fist right through their insensitive grins. Had my neighbor told me of the impending rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning. Had the Grehound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said, Oh, thats all right. Technique #34 Its the Receivers Ball A football player wouldnt last two beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the ball with the receiver always in mind. Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it. How to Give Them the Bad News (and Have Them Like You All the More) 133 Ill catch the next one. Big winners, when they bear bad news, deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded person is sure to have. Big winners know how to give bad news to people. They also know how not to give any news to anyone, even when people are pressuring them. Lets explore that next. How to Respond When You Dont Want to Answer (and Wish Theyd Shut the Heck Up) One of my clients Barbara, a ministar in the furniture business, recently separated from her husband and business partner, Frank, a megastar in the furniture business. They suffered a long and messy divorce that resulted in them keeping the business jointly but not having to deal with each other. Soon after the divorce, I was at an industry convention with Barbara. Since she and Frank were both beloved in the industry, people were curious about what had happened and how it affected their company. But, of course, no one dared ask outright. And Babara was offering no explanations. I was seated next to Barbara at the gala farewell dinner. Appaently one of her colleagues at the table couldnt contain her curioity any longer. During dessert, she leaned over to Barbara and in a hushed voice asked, Barbara, what happened with you and Frank? Barbara, unruffled by the rude question, simply took a spooful of her cherries jubilee and said, Weve separated, but the copany is unaffected. 134 How to Respond When You Dont Want to Answer 135 Not satisfied with that answer, the woman pumped harder. Are you still working together? Barbara took another bite of her dessert and repeated in prcisely the same tone of voice, Weve separated, but the company is unaffected. The frustrated interrogator was not going to give up easily. Are you both still working in the company? Barbara, appearing not the least disturbed by the womans incontinent insistence, scooped the last cherry out of her dish, smiled, looked directly at her, and said in the identical tone of voice, Weve separated, but the company is unaffected. That shut her up. Barbara had shown her big winners badge by using The Broken Record technique, the most effective way to curtail an unwelcome cross-examination. Technique #35 The Broken Record Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never fails to flick them off. HowtoTalktoa Celebrity Suppose youve just settled in for dinner at a nice restaurant. You look over at the next table, and who do you see? Is it really he? Could it possibly be? Its gotta be a look-alike. No, it isnt! It really is . . . Woody Allen. (Substitute any celebrity here: your favorite movie star, politician, broadcaster, boss who owns the company that owns the company you work for.) And there the celestial body is in the flesh, sitting not ten feet from you. What should you do? Nothing! Big shots dont slobber over stars. Let the luminary enjoy a brief moment of anonymity. If he or she should cast a glance in your direction, give a smile and a nod. Then waft your gaze back to your dining companion. You will be a lot cooler in the eyes of your dinner partner if you take it all in your stride. Now, if you just cant resist this once-in-a-lifetime opportnity to press the flesh of the megastar and tell him or her of your admiration, heres how to do it with grace. Wait until you or the luminary are leaving the restaurant. After the check has been paid and you will obviously not be taking much of his or her time, you may make your approach. Say something like, Mr. Allen, I just want to tell you how much pleasure your wonderful films have given me over the years. Thank you so much. 136 Did you pick up the subtlety here? You are not complimening his work. After all, he might well ask himself, who are you to judge whether I am a great filmmaker or not? You can only speak from your own perspective. You do this by telling him how much pleasure his work has given you. If its your bosss bosss bosss boss whom the fates have sent to bask in your adulation, do the same. Do not say Bill or Mr. Gates, you really run a great company. Lowly geek, he thinks, who are you to judge? Instead, tell him what an honor it is to work for him. Obviously this is not the moment to detail the intricacies of your improvements on imagediting software for digitizing photographs. Then let your body language express that if Woody or Bill or the other megastar wants to leave it at that, you are happy with the exchange. If, however, the megastar is captivated by you (or has had so much liquid merriment that he or she has decided to mingle with the masses tonight), then all bets are off. Youre on your own. Enjoy! Until you pick up the first body-language sign that they would like to end it. Think of yourself as a ballroom dance student waltzing with your teacher. He leads, you follow. And he tells you when the waltz is over. Incidentally, if the megastar is with a companion and your conversation goes on for more than a few moments, direct some comments at the companion. If the satellite is in such stellar copany, he or she is probably also an accomplished person. Felicia, a friend of mine, is a talented trial lawyer who is maried to a local TV-show host. Because Tom is on television, peple recognize him wherever they go, and Felicia gets ignored. Felicia tells me how frustrating it is, even for Tom. Whenever they go to a party, people gush all over Tom, and Felicias fascinating work hardly ever gets mentioned. She and Tom used to love going out to dinner, but now they hide out at home in the evenings. How to Talk to a Celebrity 137 Why? Because they cant stand the interruptions of overly effevescent fans. I Love What You Used to Be [You Has-Been] Another sensitivity: the film star is probably obsessed with his last film, the politician with her last election, a corporate mogul with his last takeover, an author with her last noveland so forth. So when discussing the stars, the politicians, the moguls, the authors, or any VIPs work, try to keep your comments to current or recent work. Telling Woody Allen how much you loved his 1980 film Stardust Memories would not endear you to him. What about all my wonderful films since? thinks he. Stick to the present or very recent past if possible. A final celebrity codicil: Suppose you are fortunate enough to have one at your party. To shine some star light on your party, dont ask the TV host to say a few words. Dont ask the singer Technique #36 Big Shots Dont Slobber People who are VIPs in their own right dont slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, dont compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight its given you. If you do single out any one of the stars accomplishments, make sure its a recent one, not a memory thats getting yellow in her scrapbook. If the queen bee has a drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the conversation. to sing a song. What looks effortless to the rest of us because they seem so comfortable performing is work for them. You wouldnt ask an accountant guest to look over your books. Or a dentist to check out your third left molar. Let the dignitary drink. Let the luminary laugh. Celebrities are people, too, and they like their time off. How to Talk to a Celebrity 139 How to Make Them Want to Thank You To wrap up our section on sounding like the big boys and big girls, here is a simple and gracious little maneuver. It not only signals people youre a top communicator, but it encourages them to keep doing nice things for you. Or complimenting you. Or doing bus ness with you. Or loving you. It is very short. It is very sweet. It is very simple. You can use it with everyone in your life. When it becomes instinctive, youll find yourself using it every day. Very simply, never let the phrase thank you stand naked and alone. Always make it thank you for something. People use the bare exposed thank you so often that people dont even hear it anymore. When we buy the morning newspaper, we flash a naked thank you at the vendor when he gives us our nickels change. Is that the same thank you you want to give a valued customer who makes a big purchase in your store? Or a loved one who cooks you a delicious dinner? Whenever the occasion warrants more than an unconscious acknowledgment, dress up your thank you with the reason: Thank you for coming. Thank you for being so understanding. 140 How to Make Them Want to Thank You 141 Thank you for waiting. Thank you for being such a good customer. Thank you for being so loving. Often, when I disembark an airplane, the captain and first officer are standing by the cockpit door to bid the passengers farewell. I say, Thanks for getting us here. Admittedly, thats carying Never the Naked Thank You technique to extremes, but it has a surprising effect. They fall all over themselves with Oh, thanks for flying with us! Thank you for reading this section of How to Talk to Anyone! Now let us move on to another conversation challenge, how to talk knowledgeably with everyonefrom groups of accountants to Zen Buddhistsno matter how little you might have in common.

        "text": "PART FOUR How to Be an Insider in Any Crowd What Are They All Talking About? Has it ever happened to you? Everyone at the party is speaking gobbledygook. Theyre all discussing faulty audits, code costraints, or the library marketand you have no idea what theyre talking about. Its because everybody at the party is an accoutant, an architect, or a publisherand youre not. So you stand there with a pasty smile on your face, not opeing your mouth. If you do, you fear the wrong thing will come out. Paranoia sets in. Everybody will snicker at you. Youre an ousider. So you suffer in silence. In high school I suffered a massive case of Silent Outsider Syndrome, especially around males. All they wanted to talk about was cars. I knew nothing about cars. The only time Id ever set foot in a body shop was to get a suntan. Well, one fateful day, Mama came home with a gift for me that transformed my teenage existence from shy to sociable. It was a book on all the current model cars and their differences over and under the hood. One reading, and I became fluent in Fords, Chevys, and Buicks. I no longer hyperventilated when boys said words like carburetor, alternator, camshaft, or exhaust manifold. I 143 didnt need to learn a lot, just enough to ask the right questions to get the guys talking. When Id learned to speak car with the boys, it worked wonders for my social life. Cut to today. We grown-up boys and girls also have our favorite topics that usually involve our work or our hobbies. When were with people in our own field or who share our interests, we open up like small-town gossips. (Even engineers who have a costant case of cat-got-their-tongue start gabbing about greasy tubines and various projects when theyre together.) To outsiders, our conversation sounds like gobbledygook. But we know precisely what its about. Its our own jobbeldygook or hobbydygook. You fear youll find yourself in a party of squash players when youre the type of person whod rather be in court than on court? Dont panic hearing words like lobbing and hitting rails roll off the squash players tongues. So what if the only experience youve ever had with squash was the mashed acorn variety on your plate next to the turkey last Thanksgiving. All you need is the few techniques that follow. Just as anglers throw out a dragonfly to get the fish to bite, all you have to do is throw out the right questions to get people to open up. Dale Carnegies adage, show sincere interest and people will talk, only goes so far. As they say in poker, it takes jacks or better to open. And in conversation, it takes cursory knowledge or better about their field to get them to really open up. You must have knowledgeable curiosity, the kind that makes you sound like youre worth talking to. In this section, we explore techniques that are Open Sesames to get people gabbing with you like an insider. How to Be a ModerDay Renaissance Man or Woman Whenever friends visit my hometown, New York City, I warn them Never ask anyone riding in the subway for directions. Because Ill get mugged? they fearfully ask. No, just because youll never get where youre going! Most Big Apple subway riders know only two things about the subway: where they get on and where they get off. They know nothing about the rest of the system. Most people are like NYC strap-hangers when it comes to their hobbies and interests. They know their own pastimes, but all the others are like unvisited stations. My unmarried (and wishing she werent) friend Rita has a bad case of bowlers thumb. Every Wednesday night shes bowling up a storm with her friends. She is forever discussing her scores, her averages, and her high game. Another single and searching friend Walter is into white-water rafting. He talks endlessly with his padling friends about which rivers hes run, which outfitters hes gone with, and which class rapids he prefers. Thinking my two single friends might hit it off, I introduced Walter the paddler to Rita the bowler and mentioned their respective passions. Oh youre a bowler! said Walter. Yes, Rita smiled demurely, awaiting more questions about her big bowling turn-on. Walter was silent. 145 Masking her disappointment, Rita said, Uh, Leil tells me youre into water rafting. Walter smiled proudly, awaiting further friendly interrogation on paddling. Uh, that must be exciting. Isnt it dangerous? was the best Rita could do. No, its not dangerous, Walter patronizingly responded to her typical outsiders question. Then the conversation died. During the deafening silence, I remember thinking, if Rita had run just one river, if Walter had bowled just one game, their lives might be different now. Conversation could have flowed, and who knows what else might have flowered. Go Fly a Kite! The Scramble Therapy technique is salvation from such disapointing encounters. It will transform you into a modern-day Renaissance man or woman who comfortably can discuss a varety of interests. Scramble Therapy is, quite simply, scrambling up your life and participating in an activity youd never think of indulging in. Just one out of every four weekends, do something totally out of your pattern. Do you usually play tennis on weekends? This weekend, go hiking. Do you usually go hiking? This weekend, take a tenis lesson. Do you bowl? Leave that to your buddies this time. Instead, go white-water rafting. Oh, you were planning on runing some rapids like you do every warm weekend? Forget it, go bowling. Go to a stamp exhibition. Go to a chess lecture. Go ballooing. Go bird-watching. Go to a pool hall. Go kayaking. Go fly a kite! Why? Because it will give you conversational fodder for the rest of your life. From that weekend on, youll sound like an insider with all the hikers, stamp collectors, ballooners, birders, billiards players, kayakers, and kitists you ever meet. Just by doing their activity once. How to Be a Modern-Day Renaissance Man or Woman 147 If you take a piece of blue litmus paper and dip it in a huge vat of acid, the tip turns pink. If you take another blue litmus paper and dip it into just one minuscule drop of acid on a glass slide, the tip turns just as pink. Compare this to participating in an activity just one time. A sampling gives you 80 percent of the converstional value. You learn the insiders questions to ask. You start using the right terms. Youll never be at a loss again when the subject of extracurricular interests comes upwhich it always does. Do You Speak Scuba? Im not a certified scuba diver. However, six years ago in Bermuda I saw a sign: Resort Dives, $25, no Scuba experience necessary. In just three hours, I received the best crash course in talking with scuba divers the world offers. First I was given a quick lesson in the pool. Then, struggling to stay erect under the weight of my oxygen tank, regulator, buoancy compensator, and weight belt, I went clumping out to the dive boat. Sitting there on the rocking dinghy, fondling my mask and fins like worry beads, I overheard the certified divers asking each other insider questions: Where were you certified? Where have you dived? Do you prefer wrecks or reefs? Ever done any night diving? Are you into underwater photography? Do you dive on a computer? Whats your longest bottom time? Did you ever get the bends? Why the italicized words? Those are scuba lingo. I now speak scuba. To this day, whenever I meet divers, I have the right quetions to ask and subjects to discuss. And the right ones to avoid. (Like how much I like seafood. Thats like telling a cat lover how much you love tender barbecued kitten.) I can now ask my new friends which of the scuba hot spots theyve been toCozumel, Cayman, Cancun. Then, if I want to really show off, I ask if theyve been to Truk Lagoon in the Far Pacific, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, or the Red Sea. All the insider terms now roll comfortably off my tongue. Before my Scramble Therapy experience Id be calling their beloved wrecks and reefs sunken ships and coral. Unde standable words, but not scuba words. Not insider words. Upon meeting a scuba diver, I probably would have asked, Oh scuba diving. That must be interesting. Uh, arent you afraid of sharks? Not a good way to get off on the right fin with a diver. Think about it! Suppose at a dinner party, the table converstion turns to scuba diving. If you, too, had done your one-timonly dive, youd ask your diving dinner companion if he likes night diving or whether he prefers diving on wrecks or reefs. (Hell never Technique #38 Scramble Therapy Once a month, scramble your life. Do something youd never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider questions from just one exposure. How to Be a Modern-Day Renaissance Man or Woman 149 believe it when you tell him the deepest water youve ever sumerged yourself in is your own bathtub.) Then you turn to the bungee jumper seated on your left and ask him, Do you prefer chest-waist jumps or ankle jumps? If the conversation then changes to tennis, or martial arts, or chess, or coin collecting, or even bird-watching, you can keep up and keep the conversation going. What a guy! What a gal! How to Sound Like You Know All About Their Job or Hobby Even more insidious than hobby-talk is job-speak, or Jobbledgook. I still harbor social nightmares of the evening I attended a party thrown by a couple who worked in computer database maagement. As I walked in the door, I overheard one chap saying to another, When the domain relational calculus is restricted to safe expressions, its equivalent to the turple relational. . . . Thats all I stayed around for. I knew I wasnt going to undestand one bit or byte of conversation the rest of the evening. It made me long for the days when a mouse meant the furry little fellow who loves cheese, windows were the kind you bought drapes for, and the web was something spiders trapped flies in. I knew I was going to need some technical support if I was going to be compatible with this crowd. I decided then and there to learn some of the opening quetions database management types ask each other. Which I did. Now I cant wait for a second chance at that crowd because Im armed with questions like What raid level are you using? and What data warehousing product do you use? All you need are a few insider opening questions to get you started with any group. You ask questions, listen to the responses, and indulge in elementary on-target conversation with them for a 150 How to Sound Like You Know All About Their Job or Hobby 151 moment or two about their field. (Then change the subject ASAP! You dont want to fake you are more knowledgeable about their field than you really are.) Its All in the Opening Question A tennis player can tell immediately from just appraising your opening serve how good a player you are. Is it going to be great playing with you or a real bore? Its the same in communicating. Just from your verbal opening serve, someone knows if its going to be interesting talking with you about their life or interestsor dull, dull, dull. For example, suppose Im introduced to someone and the first words out of her mouth are, Oh, youre a writer. When are you going to write the great American novel? Yikes, I know Im taling with someone who is unfamiliar with my world. Well chat, but I prefer to change the subject. And soon, my conversation partner. If, however, my new acquaintance says, Oh youre a writer. Do you write fiction or nonfiction? Bingo! Now I know Im with a person who knows about my world. Why? Because that is the first question all writers ask each other. I enjoy talking to this inquisitor because I presume she has more insights into the wriing world. Even if we quickly get off the subject of writing, she has come across as a well-informed individual. Every job, every sport, every interest has insider opening quetions that everybody in the same field asksand its dumb ousider questions that they never ask each other. When an astronaut meets another astronaut, he asks, What missions have you been on? (Never How do you go to the bathroom up there?) A detist asks another dentist, Are you in general practice or do you have a specialty? (Never Heard any good pain jokes lately?) The good news is beginning Jobbledygook is an easy language. You dont need to master buzzwords, only a few opening questions to make you sound like an insider. Thenheres the fun part when you tell them youre not connected to their field, theyre all the more impressed. What a knowledgeable person! they say to themselves. Help! Everybody There Will Be an Artist Its not hard to harvest good Jobbledygook. Lets say youve been invited to a gallery opening where youll be meeting many artists. If you dont speak artist, go through your Rolodex to see if you have an artist friend or two. Aha, you found one. Well, sort of. Your friend Sally attended art school. You call her up and ask, Sally, I know this sounds silly but Ive been invited to an event where Im bound to be talking with a lot of artists. Could you give me a few good questions to ask? Sally might find your query a tad unusual, but your diligence should impress her. Maybe shell say, Well, ask artists what medium they work in. Medium? you ask. Sure, shell tell you. Thats the insiders way to ask if they work with acrylics, oil, charcoal, pen, and so forth. Oh. Dont ask artists to describe their work, she warns. They feel theirs is a visual medium that cant be described. Oh. And dont ask them if their work is in a gallery. Oh? That could be a sore point. Instead ask Is there anyplace I might see your work? Theyll love that because, even if theyre not represented by a gallery, they can invite you to their studio to possibly buy their work. How to Sound Like You Know All About Their Job or Hobby 153 Technique #39 Learn a Little Jobbledygook Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a second language. What is Jobbledygook? Its the language of other professions. Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider. How do you learn it? Youll find no Jobbledygook cassettes in the language section of your bookstore, but the lingo is easy to pick up. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd youll be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few and the rewards are manifold. Thats all you need to get startedtwo good opening art questions and a warning against the most-asked dumb outsider question. Lets say youve given a great opening serve with the right question on their job. Youve slammed a swift ball dead center into their conversational court. Happily, thinking theyre with an ace player, they answer your question. Then they put a little spin on the ball and send it lobbing right back into your court and its time for a follow-up question. Whoops, what to do now? If you dont want to come out of the bluffers closet just yet, you must master the next technique, Baring Their Hot Button. How to Bare Their Hot Button (Elementary Doc-Talk) My friend John, a physician, recently married a charming Japnese woman, Yamika. John told me the first time they were invited to a party to meet many of Johns colleagues, Yamika was panistricken. She wanted to make a good impression, yet she was tense about talking to American doctors. John was the only one shed ever met, and during their romance they didnt spend a whole lot of time discussing medicine. John told her, Dont worry about it, Yami. They all ask each other the same old questions. When you meet them, just ask, Whats your specialty and Are you affiliated with a hospital? Then, to get into deeper conversation, he continued, throw out questions like Hows your relationship with your hospital? or Hows the current medical environment affecting you? These are hot issues with doctors because everythings changing in health care. John said Yamika delivered the lines verbatim. She circulated the party asking the various doctors specialties and inquiring about their affiliations and relationships with their hospitals. As a result, she was the hit of the party. Many of Johns colleagues later congratulated him on having found such a charming and insighful woman. 154 How to Bare Their Hot Button (Elementary Doc-Talk) 155 Getting the Real Grabber Its not just doctors. Every profession has concerns that are all the buzz within the industry. The rest of the world, however, knows little about these fixations. For example, independent booksellers constantly complain that big superstore chains are taking over the industry. Accountants lie awake nights worrying about liability insurance for faulty audits. And dentists grind their teeth over OSHA and EPA regulations. Oh, us writers, too. Were always bellyaching about magazines not paying us for electronic rights to our precious words. Suppose some hapless soul were unlucky enough to find hiself in a party of writers. Making conversation with these folks (who seldom know what they think until they see what they say) is no easy task for one who is accustomed to communicating in the spoken word. However, if before the party the nonwriter had called just one writer acquaintance and asked about the burning issues, hed have had hot conversation with the wordsmiths all ev ning. I call the technique Baring Their Hot Button. Back to the art show youre about to attend. You cant let Sally hang up yet. Shes given you the two best opening questions for Technique #40 Baring Their Hot Button Before jumping blindly into a bevy of bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons. artists. But dont let her go until you get the real conversational grabber. Ask her the hottest issues going on in the art world. She might think a minute and then say, Well, theres always art prices. Art prices? you ask. Yes, she explains. For example, in the 1980s the art world was very market-driven. Prices went sky-high because some investors and status seekers paid exorbitant amounts. We feel that kind of took art away from the masses. Wow, now youre really armed with some good insider art talk! See You at the Big One! While youre at it, dont forget to grill your informant for special insider greetings to use when youre with their gang. For example, actresses cringe if they hear good luck before a show, but they smile at well-wishers who say Break a leg! Break a leg, however, is not appropriate for runners before a marathon. Thats the last thought they want to have! The only thing they want to break is their personal record. Try Have a pesonal best! Firefighters who work on shift seldom see each other except, of course, at the biggest blazes. Thus the firefighters greeting See ya at the big one! Once, driving in a sleepy town youd have to work at getting lost in, I succeeded. I was hopelessly turned around. Happily, I spotted the firehouse and a couple of bored firefighters lounging out front. Excuse me, can you tell me the way back to Route 50? I called out the window. I could tell from their attitude they thought I was an idiot. Nevertheless, they lethargically pointed me in the right direction. As I drove off, I called out, Thanks guys, see ya at the big one! In the rearview mirror I saw huge smiles break out on their faces as they stood up in unison and waved good-bye. The disoriented dizzy blond driving off had won their respect with their insider salute. How to Secretly Learn About Their Lives Lets say your paper carrier has just hurled the newspaper from his bike to your front door. You pour a cup of coffee and get cofortable to catch up on whats happening in the world. Your world, that is. Do you flip first to the international news? The fashion se tion? The sports page? The entertainment section? Maybe the comics? Whichever section you usually flip to first, tomorrow DONT. Turn to any other section, preferably one you hardly ever read. Why? Because it will familiarize you with other worlds so that you can soon discuss anything with anybody, no matter how little you have in common. How about the real estate section? Yawn. Maybe you dont find real estate especially engrossing. However, sooner or later youre going to find yourself with a group of people who are dicussing properties, deals, and todays market. Scanning the real estate section just once every few weeks will keep you au courant with their conversation. The advertising column? Maybe you think the world would be a far, far better place without Madison Avenue. But your botom line wont be better off if you cant hold your own discussing matters with the marketing maven youve just contracted to adver157 tise your companys widgets. Just a few peeks at the advertising news section and youll soon be chatting about campaigns and crative people, and doing print or TV. Instead of saying words, youll be saying copy. Instead of the agency, youll be bandying about real insider terms like the shop. Using outsider words is one of the biggest giveaways that you are not in the know. On the ship, if a passenger asked any of my staff, How long have you been working on the boat? theyd squelch a groan. Cruise staffers proudly worked on a ship, and the word boat revealed the passenger as a real landlubber. The right word can perform conversational miracles. In the receiving line, whenever passengers asked our laconic captain, When did you first become a master? or What was your first command? he would hold up the entire line of people snaking around the ballroom waiting to shake his hand. Captain Cafiero would enthusiastically recount his naval history to the savvy inquirer who might have just learned the words master or comand last week in the newspaper shipping notices. (If the passeger had simply said, How long have you been a captain? or What was your first boat? he or she would have gotten the ca tains usual Italian gentlemans version of the bums rush.) Soon youll become addicted to the high that establishing raport with so many people gives you. All it takes is reading diffeent sections of the newspaper. Pump Their Pulp for Even More Fuel Then, when you crave a bigger hit of insider lingo, start reading trade journals. Those are the closed-circulation magazines that go to members of various industries. Ask your friends in different jobs to lend you one so youll have even more fuel for the convers tional fire. All industries have one or two. Youll see big glossy rags with names like Automotive News, Restaurant Business, Pool and Spa How to Secretly Learn About Their Lives 159 News, Trucking Industry, and even Hogs Today for people in the pig business. (Excuse me, they call themselves swine practitioners. Hey, you never know when, to make your next big sale, it will help to speak pig.) Any one issue will give you a sample of their lingo and inform you of the hottest issues in that field. When it comes to peoples hobbies and interests, browse through magazines on running, working out, bicycling, skiing, swimming, and surfing. Large magazine stores carry biker rags, boxer rags, bowler rags, even bull-riding rags. Youll find thousands of special-interest magazines published every month. Several years ago, I got hooked on buying a different one each week. It paid off quickly when a potential consulting client invited me to dinner at her home. She had a beautiful garden and, thanks to Flower and Garden Magazine, I could throw out insider terms like ornamentals, annuals, and perennials. I could even keep up when the discussion turned to the advantages of growing from seeds or bulbs. Because I was so fluent in flower, she invited me to take a longer walk with her to see her private back gardens. As we Technique #41 Read Their Rags Is your next big client a golfer, runner, swimmer, surfer, or skier? Are you attending a social function filled with accountants or Zen Buddhistsor anything in between? There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than youll ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading the rags that serve their racket. (Have you read your latest copy of Zoonooz yet?) strolled, I gradually changed the subject from chrysanthemums to the consulting work I could do for her company. Who was leaing whom down the garden path? Is the world getting smaller, or are we getting bigger? Todays Renaissance man or woman is comfortable and confident anwhere. The next technique helps you be an insider wherever you find yourself on the planet, and it saves you from fulfilling the worlds fantasy of the ugly American. How to Talk When Youre in Other Countries Say youre traveling abroad on business and you want to be a global insider. Whats the first thing on your to-do list? Get a passport and a phrase book, right? After all, who wants to wander around Rome not knowing how to ask for a restroom? Or be thirsty in Kuala Lumpur not knowing how to ask for a soda? Hoever, theres something most of us forget to pack, often with dire consequencesa book on international customs. A friend of mine, a fellow speaker named Geraldine, was excited about her first speech in Japan. To be comfy on her long flight to Tokyo, she donned her favorite designer jeans and a casual jacket. Fourteen hours and 6,737 miles later, four impeccably dressed Japanese gentlemen greeted her at Narita Airport. Smiing and bowing low, they handed her their business cards. With her carry-on bag in one hand, Geri took their cards with the other. She thanked them, glanced briefly at the cards, and packed them safely into her back pocket. She then pulled one of her business cards out of her purse and, sensitive to the fact that they might have difficulty pronouncing Geraldine, wrote her nickname Geri above her printed name. The gentlemen hovered over her card, turning it over to examine it a few times, before one of them put it in his briefcase. 161 When the five of them arrived at the hotel, they invited Geri for tea in the lobby. While sipping tea, the gentlemen presented her with a small gift which she eagerly opened. One of Geris most charming qualities is her instinctive warmth and effusiveness. She was thrilled with the gift and, in typical Geri style, she squealed, Oh, its beautiful! as she gave each of the gentlemen a little hug. At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up in unson like four frowning Siamese twins and, bowing only very slightly, mumbled Sayonara and promptly left. Poor Geri was flabbergasted. What did she do wrong? Everything! First, the jeans. Even if youre coming off a biccle in Asia, you do not meet clients casually dressed. The second mistake was Geris vulgar handling of their business cards. In Asia, the business card is one of the most important protocol tools. It is always presented and accepted reverently with both hands. (Except in Moslem Asia where the left hand is considered unclean.) Geri then put their cards away much too quickly. In Asia, peple use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each others cards and work and do not put theirs away until they getly and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Shoving it into her back jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Geri didnt discover her fourth gaffe until she returned home. One of her colleagues Bill, a seasoned business traveler, analyzed the fiasco for her. Bill told her the reason the gentlemen had turned Geraldines card over and over when she gave it to them at the ai port was to find her name, title, and company printed in Japanese on the other side. The flip side of Geris card was, of course, blank. Then, fifth horror of horrors, Geri should not have written on the card. Cards in Asia are not exactly sacred, but one should never deface them with messy handwriting. The sad tale of Geri and the Japanese gets worse. Bill broke the bad news to her: she should not have opened the gift in front How to Talk When Youre in Other Countries 163 of her clients. Why? Because in a land where saving face is critcal, it would be embarrassing to discover the gift they gave was not as nice as the one they received. (Yikes, Geri hadnt even given them a gift!) Gaffe number seven. Geris little squeal when receiving the gift was also a boo-boo. In Asia, the lower the tone of voice, the higher the rank. The final flub was, of course, giving the gentlemen a thank-you hug. Huging, highly revered in certain parts of the world is, in Japan, abs lutely unacceptable with a new client. Needless to say, Geri has not been invited back to Japan. However, she does have a gig coming up in El Salvador. This time shes smart. Shes studying up on the customs there. Happily, shes finding she can hug to her hearts content. However she shouldnt use her (or anybody elses) first name. Oh, and she must not intrduce herself as an American. After all, Salvadorans are Amercans, too! The differences round the world go on and on. Whenever I travel, I have to hit myself over the head and realize Im not in the anything-goes ol USA. I love to travel in jeans, Im an incurable hugger, and I cant wait to see whats in a gift box anybody gives me. However, whenever I plan to leave Uncle Sams shores, I check on foreign customs to see how much of myself I can be. Technique #42 Clear Customs Before putting one toe on foreign soil, get a book on dos and taboos around the world. Before you shake hands, give a gift, make gestures, or even compliment anyones possessions, check it out. Your gaffe could gum up your entire gig. There are some excellent books on international customs. Youll find the names of a few in the notes. 1719 Dont be like another hapless colleague of mine who almost blew a big business deal with a Brazilian. Just before signing the contract, he gave the OK sign with his thumb and forefinger. Litle did he know he was telling his new business partner to go have intercourse with himself. You never know until its too late. Now we come to where being an insider shows immediate, tangible, and calculable rewards. And where being an outsider really hurtsright in your pocket or purse. How to Talk Them into Getting the Insiders Price (on Practically Anything You Buy) Never underestimate human ingenuity when it comes to getting what you want. Many people expand the adage, Alls fair in love and war to All is fair in love, war, and buying what I want. To get a table at a posh restaurant on a busy night, using a celebrity name is an old ploy. My favorite ma”tre d told me he gets a lot of Robert De Niros phoning in a reservation. When their party of six or eight arrives, he hears, Im so sorry, Rob wasnt feeling well this evening. One woman, frustrated when her fake celebrity name didnt work, shouted at him, Look, who the hell do I have to be to get a table? Ill be anyone you want me to be, Goldie Hawn, Steffi Graf, Fergiejust tell me. Some people try a last-minute approach. They simply walk up to the ma”tre d at an overbooked restaurant, point to any name on the reservation book and say, Thats us. Youll witness the same cunning at overbooked hotels. Several months ago I was checking into a popular hotel for which, fortnately, I had a confirmed reservation. A loudmouthed man in front 165 of me in line shouted at the desk clerk, Whaddaya mean, no room? Im staying in this hotel tonight. If you dont have a room, Im sleeing right here on the floor. His temper tantrum was not working. And I warn you, he continued, I sleep in the nude! He got a room. These crafty childish tactics are not recommended. Rather, I suggest a more principled technique called Bluffing for Bargains. It was born one afternoon sitting with an insurance broker Mr. Carson. He was trying to sell me a homeowners policy. Of course I wanted the most coverage for the least cash. Carson was a smooth operator and he was patiently explaining to me in laymans terms the benefits of certain riders he was pushing. Just as he started discussing disasters like wars and hurricanes, his phone rang. With apologies, he picked up the receiver. It was one of his colleagues. Suddenly a metamorphosis took place before my eyes. The sophisticated salesman became a palsy-walsy, reglar, down-home kinda guy chatting it up with his old buddy about umbrellas. I thought they were discussing the weather. Then the conversation turned to floaters. I now assumed they were talking about an eye problem. It took a while for me to reaize that umbrella policies and floaters were part of the insurancese they were speaking. A few minutes later, Carson said, Yeah, OK, so long, buddy, and put the phone down. He cleared his throat and again tranmogrified back into the formal sales agent patiently defining daages and deductibles to a na•ve client. Sitting there listening to bafflegab like subrogation and pro rata liability, I began to ponder, If Carsons colleague who just called wanted to buy insurance, he would have gotten a much better policy, much cheaper. In practically every industry, vedors give two prices on goods or servicesone to insiders and one to you and me. How to Talk Them into Getting the Insiders Price 167 Before I let myself get angry about this, I thought it through. Is it unfair? Not really. If the vendor doesnt have to spend time being salesman or psychologist answering the endless stream of novice questions, he can afford to give his best price. Carson wouldnt have had to take twenty minutes explaining to his coleague (as he did to me) why, if a tornado takes your house, its considered an act of God. Therefore, you lose. When know edgeable associates buy products, the vendor is happily reduced to nothing more than a purchasing agent. For very little work, he makes a small profit and is satisfied. A little bit of knowledge goes a long way when youre buying something. If you have insight into your real estate brokers botom line, hes more apt to give you the better price. If you are facile with the insider words caterers and car salesmen use to pad their profits, if youre savvy to techniques moving companies and mechanics use to bilk the unsuspecting, if you are on the lookout for lawyers methods of fattening feesin short, if you know the ropes, you will not get ripped off. You dont need to know a lot, just a few insider terms. The pro assumes, since you are convesant in some esoteric industry terms, you also know the best deal and rock-bottom price. No one put it better than my housepainter, Iggy. Sure, he told me, you gotta know how to talk to a painter. Not me, but a lotta them other guys, theyre gonna get whatever they can. Its only human nature. Especially if youre a woman and you deal with em smart, like Im gonna tell you how, their hair will stand on end. Theyll say to themselves, Hey, dis is no babe in the woods. I beter deal straight. OK, Iggy, how? He said, Tell them guys, Look the walls need very little preping. Youre not going to have to spend much time scraping and spackling. Its a clean job. Iggy told me these few sentences alone can save you hundreds of dollars. Why? Right away the painter knows you know the score and that the most time-consuming part for him is preparing the surface (prepping in painterese). Therfore, its his biggest markup item. Then, Iggy continued, when you tell em there will be no cutting in [painting two colors next to each other], your price goes down again. Be sure and tell em not to leave any holidays [unpainted or sparsely painted spots] and you get a more careful job. Im only sorry I dont have an Iggy in every field to give me a crash course in how to deal. How to Deal When Theres No Iggy in Your Life Heres how to get the best price and the best deal from anyone. Find your Iggy Informer. If you have a friend in the business, get the lingo from him. If not, instead of going straight to the vendor you want to buy from, visit several others first. Talk with them. Learn a little lingo from each. For instance, suppose you want to buy a diamond. Instead of going right to your favorite jewelry shop and asking dumbbell dimond questions, go to the competition. Make friends with the salesclerk and pick up a few gems of diamondese. Youll learn jeelers say stones, not diamonds. When youre talking about the top of the stone, they say table; the widest part is the girdle; the botom is the cutlet. If the stone looks yellow, dont say yellow, say cape. If you see flaws, dont say flaws, say inclusions or gletz. If you still dont like the stone, dont say Id like to see something beter, say finer. (Dont ask me why. Thats just the way the diamond crowd talks.) Then, when youve got your lingo down, go to where you want to buy. Because you now speak diamond, you get a much better price. How to Talk Them into Getting the Insiders Price 169 Technique #43 Bluffing for Bargains The haggling skills used in ancient Arab markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal. Before every big purchase, find several vendorsa few to learn from and one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, youre ready to head for the store where youre going to buy. Soon youll be asking furriers where the skins were dressed, moving companies for their ICC performance record, and lawyers the hourly rate of paralegals and associates. Then these folks, like Iggy the painter, will say to themselves, Hey, dis is no babe in the woodsI better deal straight. Let us now delve deeper into the world of being an insider. This time we explore how to give your conversation partner the sense that you share not only experiences but the heavy stuff. You share beliefs and values in life.",

        "text": "PART FIVE How to Sound Like Youre Peas in a Pod Why, Were Just Alike! If you squint your eyes and look up carefully at a flight of birds, youll see finches flying with finches, swallows soaring with swalows, and yellow birds winging it with yellow birds. The avian apartheid escalates. Youll never see a barn swallow with a bank swallow, or even a yellow bird hanging out with a yellow finch. Somebody said it shorter: Birds of a feather flock together. Happily, humans are smarter than birds. In one respect, at least: we have brains capable of overcoming bias. Really smart human beings work together, play together, and break bread together. Does that mean their comfort level is high? Well, that depends on the human being. Our purpose here is not to exaine the absurdity of apartheid. It is to leave no stone unturned in making sure people are completely comfortable doing business or pleasure with you. It has been proven beyond a doubt, people are most recetive to those they feel have the same values in life. In one study, 171 individuals were first given a personality and beliefs test.They were then paired off with a partner and told to go spend time together. Before meeting, half the couples were told they were very similar in beliefs to their partner. The other half were told they were dissimilar. Neither statement was true. However, when quizzed afterward on how much they liked each other, partners who believed they were similar liked each other a lot more than the couples who thought themselves to be dissimilar, demonstrating we have a predisposition toward people we believe are just like us. We are most comfortable giving our business and friendship to those we feel share our values and beliefs in life. To that end I offer six techniques to create senstions of similarity with everyone you wish. Along with making more profound rapport with customers, friends, and associates, using the following techniques develops a deeper understanding and empathy with people of all races and backgrounds. It also opens doors that might otherwise be closed to you. How to Make Them Feel Youre of the Same Class Just like the finch flaps its wings faster than the gliding eagle, peple of different backgrounds move differently. For example, Weserners used to the wide-open plains stand farther from each other. Easterners, systematically sardined into subways and crowded busses, stand closer. Asian Americans make modest movements. Italian Americans make massive ones. At teatime, the finishing-school set genuflects and gracefully lowers derrieres onto the sofa. When the ladies reach for a cup, they hold the saucer in one hand and the cup in the other, pinkie ever so slightly extended. Folks who never finished any manners school make a fanny dive in the middle of the sofa and clutch the cup with both hands. Is one right? Is the other wrong? No. However, top commnicators know when doing business with a derriere-dipping pinkie extender or a fanny-plopping, two-fisted mug grabber, they darn well should do the same. People feel comfortable around people who move just like they do. I have a friend who travels the country giving an outrageous seminar called How to Marry the Rich. Genie was once in a Las Vegas casino when a television reporter asked if she could tell the real rich from the great pretenders. 173 Of course, Genie answered. All right, challenged the reporter. Who is the wealthiest man in this room? Convened at the next table were three men in tailored suits (Hayward of Mayfair, London, no doubt), hanmade shirts (Charvet of Place Vend™me in Paris, no doubt), and sipping scotch (single-malt Laphroaig from the Scottish island of Islay, no doubt). The reporter, naturally, assumed Genie would choose one of these likely candidates. Instead, with the scrutiny of a hunting dog, Genies eyes scanned the room. Like a trained basset hound, she instinctively pointed a long red fingernail at a fellow in torn jeans at a corner table. She murmured, Hes very rich. Flabbergasted, the reporter asked Genie, How can you tell? He moves like old money, she said. You see, Genie went on to explain, theres moving like old money. Theres moving like new money. And theres moving like no money. Genie could tell the unlikely chap in the corner was obviously sitting on big assets and all because of the way he moved. Technique #44 Be a Copyclass Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy? Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your conversation partner subliminally real comfy with you. How to Make Them Feel Youre of the Same Class 175 Theyre Buying You, Too If youre in sales, copy not only your customers class but the class of your product as well. I live in a section of New York City called Soho, which is a few blocks above the famous-for-being-trashy Canal Street. Often, clutching my purse tightly and dodging the crowds on Canal Street, Ill pass a pickpocket-turned-salesmafor-the-day. He furtively looks around and flashes a greasy hankerchief at me with a piece of jewelry on it. Psst, wanna buy a gold chain? His nervous thiefs demeanor alone could get him arrested. Now, about sixty blocks uptown, youll find the fashionable and very expensive Tiffanys jewelry store. Occasionally, clutching my fantasies of being able to afford something therein, I stroll through the huge gilt doors. Imagine one of the impeccably dressed sales professionals behind the beveled glass counters furtively looking around and saying to me, Psst, wanna buy a diamond? No sale! Match your personality to your product. Selling handmade suits? A little decorum please. Selling jeans? A little cool, please. Selling sweat suits? A little sporty, please. And so on for whatever youre selling. Remember, you are your customers buying experence. Therefore you are part of the product theyre buying. How to Make Them Feel That Youre Like Family Have you ever been gabbing with a new acquaintance and, after a few moments, youve said to yourself, This person and I think alike! Were on the same wavelength. Its a fabulous feeling, almost like falling in love. Lovers call it chemistry. New friends talk of instant raport, and businesspeople say a meeting of minds. Yet its the same magic, that sudden sense of warmth and closeness, that strange sensation of Wow, we were old friends at once! When we were children, making friends was easier. Most of the kids we met grew up in the same town and so they were on our wavelength. Then the years went by. We grew older. We moved away. Our backgrounds, our experiences, our goals, our lifestyles became diverse. Thus, we fell off each others wavelengths. Wouldnt it be great to have a magic surfboard to help you hop right back on everybodys wavelength whenever you wanted? Here it is, a linguistic device that gets you riding on high rapport with everyone you meet. If you stand on a mountain cliff and shout hello-oh across the valley, your identical hello-oh thuders back at you. I call the technique Echoing because, like the mountain, you echo your conversation partners precise words. 176 How to Make Them Feel That Youre Like Family 177 It All Started Across the Ocean In many European countries, youll hear five, ten, or more laguages within the language. For example, in Italy, the Sicilians from the south speak a dialect that seems like gobbledygook to northern Italians. In an Italian restaurant, I once overheard a diner discover his waiter was also from Udine, a town in northeastern Italy where they speak the Friulano dialect. The diner stood up and hugged the waiter like he was a long-lost brother. They started babbling in a tongue that left the other Italian waiters shrugging. In America we have dialects, too. We just arent conscious of them. In fact we have thousands of different words, depending on our region, our job, our interests, and our upbringing. Once, when traveling across the country, I tried to order a soda like a Coke or 7-Up in a highway diner. It took some explaining before the wairess understood I wanted what she called a pop. Perhaps because the English-speaking world is so large, Americans have a wider choice of words for the same old stuff than any language Ive encountered. Family members find themselves speaking alike. Friends use the same words, and associates in a company or members in a club talk alike. Everyone you meet will have his or her own language that subliminally distinguishes them from outsiders. The words are all English, but they vary from area to area, industry to indutry, and even family to family. The Linguistic Device That Says Were on the Same Wavelength When you want to give someone the subliminal feeling youre just alike, use their words, not yours. Suppose you are selling a car to a young mother who tells you she is concerned about safety because she has a young toddler. When explaining the safety features of the car, use her word. Dont use whatever word you call your kids. Dont even say child-protection lock, which was in your sales manual. Tell your prospect, No toddler can open the widow because of the drivers control device. Even call it a toddle protection lock. When Mom hears toddler coming from your lips, she feels you are family because thats how all her relatives refer to her little tyke. Suppose your prospect had said kid or infant. Fine, echo any word she used. (Well, almost any word. If shed said my brat, you might want to pass on Echoing this time.) Echoing at Parties Lets say you are at a party. Its a huge bash with many different types of people. You are first chatting with a lawyer who tells you her profession is often maligned. When it comes your turn to speak, say profession too. If you say job, it puts a subconscious barrier between you. Next you meet a construction worker who starts talking about his job. Now youre in trouble if you say, Well, in my profession . . . hed think you were being hoity-toity. After the lawyer and the construction worker, you talk to seeral freelancersfirst a model, then a professional speaker, finally a pop musician. All three of these folks will use different words for their work. The model brags about her bookings. The professional speaker might say bookings, but he is more apt to boast of his speaing engagements. A pop musician might say, Yeah, man, I get a lot of gigs. Its tough to memorize what they all call their work. Just keep your ears open and echo their word after they say it. Echoing goes beyond job names. For example if you are chating with a boat owner and you call his boat an it, he labels you a real landlubber. (He reverently refers to his beloved boat, of course, as a she.) If you listen carefully, you hear language sutleties you never dreamed existed. Would you believe using the wrong synonym for a seemingly uncomplicated word like have How to Make Them Feel That Youre Like Family 179 labels you a know-nothing in somebody elses world? For exaple, cat lovers purr about having cats. But horse people would say owning horses. And fish folk dont own fish. They talk about keeing fish. Hey, no big deal. But if you use the wrong word, your conversation partner will assume, correctly, that you are a stranger in his or her hobbyland. The Peril of Not Echoing Sometimes you lose out by not Echoing. My friend Phil and I were talking with several guests at a party. One woman proudly told the group about the wonderful new ski chalet she had just puchased. She was looking forward to inviting her friends up to her little chalet in the mountains. Thats wonderful, said Phil, secretly hoping for an invittion. Where exactly is your cabin? KERPLUNK! There went Phils chances for an invitation to the ladys chalet. I couldnt resist. After the conversation, I whispered to my friend, Phil, why did you insult that woman by calling her chalet a cabin? Phil scratched his head and said, What do you mean insult her? Cabin is a beautiful word. My family has a cabin in Cape Cod and I grew up loving the word, the associations, the joy of a cabin. (In other words, the connotations of cabin.) Well, fine, Phil. The word cabin may be beautiful to you, but obviously the skier preferred the word chalet. Professional Echoing In todays sales environment, customers expect salespeople to be problem solvers, not just vendors. They feel you dont grasp their industrys problems if you dont speak their language. I have a friend, Penny, who sells office furniture. People in publishing, advertising, broadcasting, and a few lawyers are among her clients. Pennys sales manual says office furniture. However, she told me, if she used the word office with all of her clients, theyd assume she knew nothing about their respective industries. She told me her client, the purchasing officer in advertising, talks about his advertising agency. Pennys publishing client says publishing house. The lawyers talk about furniture for their firm, and her radio clients use the word station instead of office. Hey, Penny says, its their salt mine. They can call it whatever the heck they please. And, she added, if I want to make the sale, Id beter call it the same thing. Echoing Is Politically Correct Insurance Heres a quiz: Youre talking with a pharmacist and you ask her, How long have you worked at the drugstore? Whats wrong with that question? Give up? Its the word drugstore. Pharmacists abhor the word because it conjures up many industry problems. Theyre used to hearing it from outsiders, but its a tip-off that they are unaware of, or insensitive to, their professional problems. They prefer pharmacy. Technique #45 Echoing Echoing is a simple linguistic technique that packs a powerful wallop. Listen to the speakers arbitrary choice of nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectivesand echo them back. Hearing their words come out of your mouth creates subliminal rapport. It makes them feel you share their values, their attitudes, their interests, their experiences. How to Make Them Feel That Youre Like Family 181 Recently, at a reception, I introduced one of my friends, Susan, as a day-care worker. Afterward Susan begged, Leil, pueeze do not call me a day-care worker. Were child-care workers. Whoops! Time and recent history quickly make certain terms archaic. A groups intense preference for one word is not arbitrary. Cetain jobs, minorities, and special-interest groups often have a hitory the public is not sensitive to. When that history has too much pain attached to it, people invent another word that doesnt have bitter connotations. I have a dear friend, Leslie, who is in a wheelchair. She says whenever anyone says the word handicapped, she cringes. Leslie says it makes her feel less than whole. We prefer you say person with a disability. She then gave a moving explanation. We peple with disabilities are the same as every other able-bodied peson. We say AB, she added. ABs go through life with all the same baggage we do. We just carry one extra piece, a disability. Its simple. Its effective. To show respect and make people feel close to you, Echo their words. It makes you a more sensitive comunicatorand keeps you out of trouble every time. How to Really Make It Clear to Them I recently had to make a presentation to fifteen men in a corprate meeting. OK, I said to myself as I stood up, fifteen Matians and one Venusian. No problem! Id read Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. Id explored neurological differences in mens and womens brains. I knew all about gender-specific bodlanguage signals. Hey, I teach communications differences. I was well prepared to talk to these men, get my point across, and fend any questions. Everything started out fine. Id conceived my presentation clearly and concisely, developed each theme, and presented it flalessly. Then, I sat down and confidently invited questions and open discussion. Thats when it fell apart. All I remember is a horrifying barage of questions couched in football analogies. Do you think we dropped the ball on that one? one man asked. Yeah, another responded. But can we make a fumble recovery? Those two I understood. However, when it got to pass coerage and intentional grounding, I started to lose it. When one 182 How to Really Make It Clear to Them 183 guy raved about a Hail Mary pass being needed to save the deal, I suffered the ultimate humiliation. I had to ask, Uh, what does that mean? The guys looked at each other knowingly and then smiled condescendingly as they explained it to me. That night I had sadistic fantasies of fifteen women running the company and one man left scratching his head as we bandied about childbirth analogies. We wont get his new proposal til the third trimester, reports the account exec. Yeah, but thats six months away. Lets get it by C-section, responds the comptroller. Why bother? asks the marketing VP. All his ideas are deveoped in vitro anyway. Im about to go into postpartum depression, murmurs the CEO. The lone male employee is left as confused and humiliated as I was in the face of football analogies. Ahem, the aim of this book is not to feed fiendish fantasies, but to improve communications. To that end, I offer the folloing technique based on analogies, not just football analogies. Because old-boy analogies are unsportsman-like conduct with the girls. On-Target Analogies Hit Bulls-Eye Analogies can be an effective communications toolif you evoke images from the life of the person you are talking to. Men dont use football analogies to obfuscate matters or to confuse women but to clarify situations for each other. Analogies from the sport bring situations to life for men because generally they watch more football than women. Moving on to other sports analogies: everyone knows what the speaker means when he or she hears, Well never strike out with this solution. Nevertheless, the image would be more copelling to a baseball fan as would analogies like caught on the fly, hitting the dirt, or throwing a spit ball. Youve heard people say, This solution is right on target. We all understand it. But the phrasing would be more dramatic for archery enthusiasts. If your listener were a bowler, speaking of gutter balls or big splits would bring whatever you were dicussing to life. If your business buddies were basketball fans, analogies like hook shot or air ball would land right in their basket. If your client wrestles, saying feints and scissor holds would be the way to grab him. These analogies might sound far-fetched to you. But they are potent communications tools when they evoke your conversation partners world. Why not use the most powerful terms possible to get your point across and make the sale? I call the technique Potent Imaging. Technique #46 Potent Imaging Does your customer have a garden? Talk about sowing the seeds for success. Does your boss own a boat? Tell him or her about a concept that will hold water or stay afloat. Maybe he is a private pilot? Talk about a concept really taking off. She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits the sweet spot. Evoke your listeners interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give your points more power and punch, use analogies from your listeners world, not your own. Potent Imaging also tells your listeners you think like them and hints you share their interests. How to Really Make It Clear to Them 185 Pardon me while I return momentarily to my sadistic fantasies of the hopelessly confused lone male employee. The all-female management team is now arguing the corporate strategy using, not football of course, but ballet analogies. I say lets do the corporate takeover allegro, she suggests. Nah, you gotta go adagio in these matters, her colleague responds. But what if they do a tour jetŽ while were poised in fifth? Cmon did you ever see a good pas seul from their president? The top woman settles it. I say lets just give him a little rŽvŽrence, and then a grand battement in the balls. How to Make Them Feel You Empathize (Without Just Saying Yep, Uh Huh, Yeah) While listening to someone talk, we often vocalize uh huh or purr throaty little umm sounds to reassure the speaker we have heard their words. In fact, with some its such a habit, the noises escape their throats unconsciously. My friend Phil is a consumate, constant, and incontinent ummer whenever Im talking. Occasionally, if Im feeling contentious after hes given one of his agreeable umms in response to something Ive said, I challenge him with, OK, Phil, what did I say? Uh, well, gosh . . . Phil has no idea. Its not his fault. Hes male. Men are especially guilty of the not-really-listening umm habit. Once, when I was on a monologue about nothing in paticular, Phil was on a real umm roll. To test his listening skills, I slipped in, Yes, this afternoon I think Ill go out and get tattooed all over my body. Phil nodded his habitual uh huh. Well, umming is better than a blank stare. However, its not the choice of top communicators. Try replacing your umms with full-blown empathizers. 186 How to Make Them Feel You Empathize 187 What Are Empathizers? Empathizers are simple, short, supportive statements. Unlike uh huh, they are complete sentences such as I can appreciate you decided to do that, or That really is exciting. Empathizers can be one-sentence positive critiques like Yes, that was the honoable thing to do, or Its charming you felt that way. When you respond with complete sentences instead of the usual grunts, not only do you come across as more articulate, but your listener feels that you really understand. Of course, you pay a price. To use the right empathizers, you do need to listen. Now lets fine-tune this technique and explore advanced empathizing. Technique #47 Employ Empathizers Dont be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like I see what you mean. Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like Thats a lovely thing to say. Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue. How to Make Them Think You See/Hear/Feel It Just the Way They Do About ten years ago, I had a roommate named Brenda. Brenda was a tap dance teacher who didnt just tap dance to make a liing. She lived to tap. Posters of Bill Bojangles Robinson and Charles Honi Coles plastered her walls. She didnt walk around the house. She tapped her way from room to room. It was noisy, but at least, when a phone call came for Brenda, I never had troble finding her. Once I asked Brenda when she got interested in tap. She said, From the moment I first opened my ears. Her ears? I thought, thats strange. Most people say from the moment I opened my eyes. At that moment, I realized Brenda saw the world more through her ears than her eyes. We all perceive the world through five senses. We see the world. We hear the world. We feel the world. We smell the world. And we taste the world. Therefore, we talk in terms of those five senses. Proponents of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) tell us, for each person, one sense is stronger than others. For Brenda, it was her hearing. Brenda told me she grew up in a dark apartment below street level in New York City. She remembers, as an infant, hearing the pitter-patter of feet walking just above her crib on the sidewalk. 188 How to Make Them Think You See/Hear/Feel It Just the Way They Do 189 As a toddler, her tiny ears were bombarded with honking horns, shrieking sirens, and tire chains slapping the icy streets. She espcially remembers the clumpety-clomp of police horses hoofs on the pavement outside her window. Her first perceptions of the ouside world came to her through her ears. To this day, sound doinates her life. Brenda, the tap dancer, is an auditory person. Since neurolinguists suggest invoking our listeners strongest sense, I tried a few auditory references on Brenda. Rather than saying, That looks good to me, Id say That sounds good. Instead of saying, I see what you mean, Id say, I hear you. When I used these auditory references, I felt she paid more attention. So I started listening very carefully to all my friends to dicover which was their primary perception. Sometimes Id hear visual references like I see what you mean. That looks good to me. I cant picture myself doing that. I take a dim view of that idea. From my perspective . . . Wow, I thought I was really on to something! A Wrinkle Develops But then, whoops, at other times, Id hear that same friend say Yeah, I hear you. Sure, that sounds good to me. I kept saying to myself it would work. That has a negative ring to it. He really tuned out on the whole idea. Something tells me . . . This wasnt going to be quite as easy as Id expected. However, I wasnt ready to give up. Once, Brenda and I went skiing with several friends. That night we were at a party. One of our friends was telling a group of people, The ski slopes were beautiful. Everything was so crytal clear and white. A visual person? I asked myself. Another skier added, The feel of the fresh snow on our faces was terrific. Aha, a kinesthetic person, I mused silently. Sure enough, just then, Brenda said, Today was so silent. The only sound you could hear was the wind in your ears as you came swooshing down the slopes. That little riff convinced me there was something to it. However, I still found it difficult to discern ones primary sense. A Simple Solution Heres what Ive found does work, and it doesnt take too much detective work on your part. I call the technique Anatomically Correct Empathizers, and its easy to master. Unless it is obvious the person you are speaking with is primarily visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, simply respond in his or her mode of the moment. Match your empathizers to the current sense someone is talking through. For example, suppose a business colleague describing a financial plan says, With this plan, we can see our way clear in six months. Since this time shes using primarily visual references, How to Make Them Think You See/Hear/Feel It Just the Way They Do 191 say I see what you mean or You really have a clear picture of that situation. If, instead, your colleague had said, This plan has a good ring to it, youd substitute auditory empathizers like It does sound great, or I hear you. A third possibility. Suppose she had said, I have a gut feeling this plan will work. Now you give her a kinesthetic empathizer like I can understand how you feel, or You have a good grasp of that problem. What about the other two senses, taste and smell? Well, Ive never run up against any gustatory or olfactory types. But you could always compliment a chef by saying, Thats a delicious idea. And if you are talking to your dog (olfactory, of course), tell him The whole idea stinks. The next technique helps create affinity with a single word. Technique #48 Anatomically Correct Empathizers What part of their anatomy are your associates talking through? Their eyes? Their ears? Their gut? For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make them think you feel the same way they do. How to Make Em Think We (Instead of You vs.Me) By just eavesdropping for a few moments on any two people chating, you could tell a lot about their relationship. You could tell if they were new acquaintances or old friends. You could tell whether a man and a woman were strangers or a couple. You wouldnt even need to hear friends call each other pal, buddy, or mate. You wouldnt need to hear a man and a woman whisper dear, sweetheart, or turtle dove. It wouldnt matter what they were discussing or even their tone of voice. You could even be blindfolded and tell a lot about their relationship because the technique Im about to share has nothing to do with body language. How? A fascinating progression of conversation unfolds as people become closer. Heres how it develops: Level One: ClichŽs Two strangers talking together primarily toss clichŽs back and forth. For instance, when chatting about the universally agreeupon worlds dullest subjectthe weatherone stranger might say to the other, Beautiful sunny weather weve been having. Or, Boy, some rain, huh? Thats level one, clichŽs. 192 How to Make Em Think We (Instead of You vs. Me) 193 Level Two: Facts People who know each other but are just acquaintances often dicuss facts. You know, Joe, weve had twice as many sunny days this year to date as last. Or, Yeah, well, we finally decided to put in a swimming pool to beat the heat. Level Three: Feelings and Personal Questions When people become friends, they often express their feelings to each other, even on subjects as dull as the weather. George, I just love these sunny days. They also ask each other personal quetions: How about you, Betty? Are you a sun person? Level Four: We Statements Now we progress to the highest level of intimacy. This level is richer than facts and creates more rapport than feelings. Its we and us statements. Friends discussing the weather might say, If we keep having this good weather, itll be a great summer. Lovers might say, I hope this good weather keeps up for us so we can go swimming on our trip. A technique to achieve the ultimate verbal intimacy grows out of this phenomenon. Simply use the word we prematurely. You can use it to make a client, a prospect, a stranger feel you are already friends. Use it to make a potential romantic partner feel the two of you are already an item. I call it the Premature We. In casual conversation, simply cut through levels one and two. Jump straight to three and four. Ask your prospects feelings on something the way you would query a friend. (George, how do you feel about the new govenor?) Then use the pronoun we when discussing anything that might affect the two of you. (Do you think were going to prosper during his administration?) Make it a point to concoct we sentences, the kind people instinctively reserve for friends, lovers, and other intimates. (I think well survive while the governors in office.) The word we fosters togetherness. It makes the listener feel connected. It gives a subliminal feeling of you and me against the cold, cold world. When you prematurely say we or us, even to strangers, it subconsciously brings them closer. It subliminally hints you are already friends. At a party, you might say to someone standing behind you at the buffet line, Hey, this looks great. They really laid out a nice spread for us. Or, Uh-oh, were going to get fat if we let ourselves enjoy all of this. Well, we have just explored how to copy our conversation partners movements with Be a Copyclass, echo their words, evoke Potent Images from their world, create a bond through their prmary sense with Anatomically Correct Empathizers, and establish subliminal friendship with words like we. What else do friends, lovers, and close associates have in comon? A history. The final technique in this section is a device to give a fairly new acquaintance the warm and fuzzy feeling the two of you have been together for a long, long time. Technique #49 The Premature We Create the sensation of intimacy with someone even if youve met just moments before. Scramble the signals in their psyche by skipping conversational levels one and two and cutting right to levels three and four. Elicit intimate feelings by using the magic words we, us, and our. How to Create a Friendly Private Joke with Them Lovers whisper phrases in each others ears that mean nothing to anyone but themselves. Friends crack up over a few words that sound like gobbledygook to anyone overhearing them. Close busness associates chuckle about shared experiences. One company Ive worked with has seen reengineering, empowerment, TQM, and team building come and go in one decade. At company parties, the employees never fail to crack up over the time when the whole companymanagers to mail-room clerksscrambled up a twenty-nine-foot pole together all in the name of team building. The CEO slipped down the pole and broke his big toe. At the next weekly meeting, the CEO shook his crutch and caustically announced, No more team exercises! Thus, the death of team buildingand the birth of a private joke. Out of shared experiences like this, a company culture grows. These employees have a history and a language to go with it. To this day, whenever they want to put an abrupt end to any idea, they say, Lets shake a crutch at it or Lets slide that one down the flagpole. They all smile. Nobody knows what they mean except fellow employees. The playwright Neil Simon, sometimes with a single word, can make an entire Broadway audience understand two perform195 ers onstage are either married or longtime friends. The actor siply says something to the actress that makes no sense to the audence. Then both of them laugh uproariously. Everybody gets the message: these two people are an item. Every time my friend Daryl and I meet, we dont say Hello. We say Quack. Why? We met at a party five years ago and, in our first conversation, Daryl told me he grew up on a duck farm. When I told him Id never seen a duck farm, he performed the best human imitation of a duck Id ever seen. He flipped his head side to side looking at me first out of one eye, then the other, all the while flapping his arms and quacking. I got such a laugh out of his performance that it inspired him to do a full flat-footed duck waddle for me. It was contagious. Together we waddled around the room flapping and quacking. We made absolute fools of ouselves that evening. The next day, my phone rang. I picked up the receiver to hear, not Hello, this is Daryl, but simply, Quack. Im sure thats Technique #50 Instant History When you meet a stranger youd like to make less a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just like old friends, you have a history together, an Instant History. With anyone youd like to make part of your personal or professional future, look for special moments together. Then make them a refrain. How to Create a Friendly Private Joke with Them 197 what started our friendship. To this day, every time I hear his Quack on the phone, it floods me with happy, if a tad embarassing, memories. It recalls our history and renews our friendship no matter how long its been since we last quacked at each other. Now Whats Left? Chemistry, charisma, and confidence are three characteristics shared by big winners in all walks of life. Part One helped us make a dynamic, confident, and charismatic first impression with body language. In Part Two, we put smooth small-talk lyrics to our body ballet. Then in Part Three, we seized hints from the big boys and big girls so were contenders for lifes big league. Part Four rescued us from being tongue-tied with folks with whom we have very litle in common. And in Part Five, we learned techniques to create instant chemistry, instant intimacy, instant rapport. Whats left? You guessed itmaking people feel really good about themselves. But compliments are a dangerous weapon in todays world. One mishandling and you can butcher the rel tionship.

        "text": "PART SIX How to Differentiate the Power of Praise from the Folly of Flattery Kids are experts at getting what they want. Perched on Papas knee, Oh Daddy, youre so wunnerful. I know youll buy me that new doll. The next morning, with Mama in the supermarket, Oh Mommy, I love you. Youre the most bestest mommy in the world. I know youll buy me that chocolate munchie. From the hungry infants instinctive cooing as Mommy approaches the crib to the car salesmans calculated praise as the prospect walks into the showroom, compliments come naturally to people when they want something from somebody. In fact, compliments are the most widely used and thoroughly endorsed of all getting-what-you-want techniques. When Dale Carnegie wrote Begin with praise, fifteen million readers took it to heart. Most of us still think praise is the path to extracting what we want from someone. And yes, if its as simple as dolls from daddy and munchies from mommy, it may be. But the business world has changed 199 dramatically since Dale Carnegies day. In todays world, not every smiling flatterer has the power to procure through praise. The Malaise of Unskilled Praise You give someone a compliment. You smile, waiting to see the warm feelings engulf the recipient. You may have to wait a long time. If he or she has a speck of suspicion your praise is self-serving, it has the opposite effect. If your compliment is insincere or unskilled, it can wreck your chances of ever being trusted by that person again. It can abort a potential relationship before it ever gets off the runway. However, skilled praise is a different story. When done well, it gives the relationship immediate liftoff. It can make a sale, win a new friend, or rejuvenate a marriage on a golden anniversary. What is the difference between praise that lifts and flattery that flattens? Many factors enter the equation. They include your sincerity, timing, motivation, and wording. They also involve the recipients self-image, professional position, experience with co pliments, and judgment of your powers of perception. Of course it entails the relationship between the two of you and how long you have known each other. If youre complimenting someone by phone, E-mail, or snail mail, it even involves subtleties such as whether youve ever seen his or face, either in person or a photograph. Mind boggling, isnt it? Sociologists research shows: 1) a copliment from a new person is more potent than from someone you already know, 2) your compliment has more credibility when given to an unattractive person or an attractive person whose face youve never seen, 3) you are taken more seriously if you preface your comments by some self-effacing remarkbut only if your listener perceives you as higher on the totem pole. If youre lower, your How to Differentiate the Power of Praise from the Folly of Flattery 201 self-effacing remark reduces your credibility. Complicated, this complimenting stuff. Rather than dizzying ourselves with the surfeit of specific studies, lets just put some terrific techniques in our little bag of tricks. Each of the following meets all the criteria of social scietists findings. Here are nine effective ways to praise in the new millennium. How to Compliment Someone (Without Sounding Like Youre Brownnosing) The risk in giving a compliment face-to-face is, of course, that the distrustful recipient will assume you are indulging in shameless, obsequious pandering to achieve your own greedy goals. Its a sad reality about compliments. If you lay a big one out of the blue on your boss, your prospect, or your sweetie, the reciient will probably think youre brownnosing. Your main squeeze will assume youre suffering guilt over something youve done. So whats the solution? Hold back your sincere esteem? No, simply deliver it through the grapevine. The grapevine has long been a trusted means of communication. From the days when Catskills comics insisted the best ways to spread news were telephone, telegraph, and tell-a-woman, we have known it works. Unfortunately the grapevine is most often associated with bad news, the kind that goes in one ear and over the back fence. But the grapevine need not be laden only with scuttlebutt and sour grapes. Good news can travel through the same filament. And when it arrives in the recipients ear, it is all the more delectable. This is not a new discovery. Back in 1732, Thomas Fuller wrote, Hes my friend that speaks well of me behind my back. Were 202 How to Compliment Someone (Without Sounding Like Youre Brownnosing) 203 more apt to trust someone who says nice things about us when we arent listening than someone who flatters us to our face. No-Risk Praise (Do It Behind Their Back) Instead of telling someone directly of your admiration, tell somone who is close to the person you wish to compliment. For instance, suppose you want to be in the good graces of Jane Smith. Dont directly compliment Jane. Go to her close associate Diane Doe and say, You know, Jane is a very dynamic woman. She said something so brilliant in the meeting the other day. Someday shell be running this company. I place ten-to-one odds your comment will get back to Jane via the grapevine in twenty-four hours. Diane will tell her friend, You should hear what so n so said about you the other day. When you gave Grapevine Glory to Jane, Diane became the carrier pigeon of that compliment. Which leads us to the next technique where you become the carrier pigeon of other peoples compliments. Technique #51 Grapevine Glory A compliment one hears is never as exciting as the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend. This way you escape possible suspicion that you are an apple-polishing, bootlicking, egg-sucking, bac scratching sycophant trying to win brownie points. You also leave recipients with the happy fantasy that you are telling the whole world about their greatness. HowtoBea Carrier Pigeon of Good Feelings Carrier pigeons have a long and valiant history. The dauntless winged messengers, often maimed by shellfire and dying after delivering their messages, have saved the lives of thousands. One tenacious little bird named Cher Ami is credited with saving two hundred lives during the Battle of the Argonne in World War I. The brave one-legged little birdie, one of his wings shot through, carried a message dangling from his remaining ligament. The blood-smeared little ball of feathers arrived just in time to warn that the Germans were about to bomb the city. Stumpy Joe, another plucky pigeon, had such a heroic battlscarred career that his fans stuffed him, mounted him, and put him on display in the National Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. And millions of other brave birds have brought joyful mesages to racing-pigeon enthusiasts around the world. In that fine tradition, I present the complimenting technique I call Carrier Pigeon Kudos. Whenever you hear a laudatory comment about someone, dont let it end there. You dont need to write it, roll it up in a casule, strap it to your leg like Stumpy Joe, and fly it to the recipent. Nevertheless, you can remember the kudo and verbally carry it to the person who will get the most pleasurethe person who was complimented. 204 How to Be a Carrier Pigeon of Good Feelings 205 Keep your ears open for good things people say about each other. If your colleague Carl says something nice about another colleague, Sam, pass it on. You know, Sam, Carl said the nicest thing about you the other day. Your sister tells you your first cousin is a dynamite relative. Go ahead and call Cuz. Your mother tells you she thinks Manny did a great job moing the lawn. Pass it on to him. Hey, we all like a little apprecition, even from Mom. Heres where it benefits you. Everyone loves the bearer of glad tidings. When you bring someone third-party kudos, they apprciate you as much as the complimenter. Call it gossip if you like. This is the good kind. Carry More Cargo than Compliments Another way to warm hearts and win friends is to become a carier pigeon of news items that might interest the recipient. Call, mail, or E-mail people with information they might find interestTechnique #52 Carrier Pigeon Kudos People immediately grow a beak and metamorphosize themselves into carrier pigeons when theres bad news. (Its called gossip.) Instead, become a carrier of good news and kudos. Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment. Your fans may not posthumously stuff you and put you on display in a museum like Stumpy Joe. But everyone loves the carrier pigeon of kind thoughts. ing. If your friend Ned is a furniture designer in North Carolina and you see a big article in the Los Angeles Times about furniture trends, fax it to him. If your client Sally is a sculptor in Seattle and you see her work in someones home in New York, send her a note. My friend Dan lives in San Francisco, and whenever he runs across anything in the paper on communications, he clips it and sends it to me. No note, just FYIRegards, Dan in the corner. Hes like my own private West Coast clipping service. Try it. Think of the money youll save on greeting cards. A relevant clipping is the big winners way of saying, Im thinking of you and your interests. How to Make Em Feel Your Admiration Just Slipped Out Heres yet another caress for someones ego. Dont give a blatant compliment. Merely imply something magnificent about your coversation partner. Several months ago, I was visiting an old friend in Denver whom I hadnt seen in a long time. When he came to my hotel to pick me up, he said, Hello, Leil, how are you? Then he paused, looked at me, and said, Youve obviously been well. Wow, I felt terrific. He implied I looked good and that made my evening. Guess the Good Lord decided I shouldnt have too swollen a head, however, because later that evening, after my friend dropped me off, I got into the hotel elevator. A maintenance man entered at the third floor. He smiled at me. I smiled back. He looked at me again and said, Gosh, maam, was you a model? [Oh, man, was I feeling on top of the world now!] . . . when you was young? he continued. CRASH! Why couldnt he have zipped his lip before the zinger? I loved the implication in the first part of his comment. But the second implied I was now an old lady. Ruined my next day. Heck, his unintentional low blow ruined my week. In fact I still feel wretched about it. 207 You have to be careful of unintentional bad implications. If, visiting a new city, you stop someone on the street and say, Excuse me, could you tell me if there are any fine dining restaurants nearby? you are implying the passerby is a person of taste. If, however, you ask that same passerby, Hey, know any down and dirty bars in this burg? your implication is entirely different. Find a way to imply magnificent qualities of those you wish to indrectly compliment. Technique #53 Implied Magnificence Throw a few comments into your conversation that presuppose something positive about the person youre talking with. But be careful. Dont blow it like the welintentioned maintenance man. Or the southern boy who, at the prom, thought he was flattering his date when he told her, Gosh, Mary Lou, for a fat gal you dance real good. How to Win Their Hearts by Being an Undercover Complimenter Next in our agglomeration of joy spreaders is a technique I call Accidental Adulation. Once, at a small dinner party, the subject turned to space travel. The gentleman seated to my right said, Leil, youre much too young to remember this, but when Apollo 11 landed on the moon . . . If my life depended on it, I couldnt tell you what the chap said next. I simply remember smiling to myself and stretching to get a glimpse of my youthful self in the dining-room mirror. Of course I remember July 1969. Like the rest of the world, I was glued to the television watching Neil Armstrongs size 9 1Ú2 B boot hit the moon. However, I certainly was not thinking of moon travel at that dinner party. I was too busy reveling in the fact that this lovely man didnt think I was old enough to remember 1969. I assumed his opinion of my youthfulness just slipped out. Ther fore it must be sincere. Sure! Now that I think about it, he probably knew darn well I was old enough to remember the moon landing. I bet he was 209 using the maneuver Accidental Adulation. But it doesnt matter. My warm memories of him remain. Accidental Adulation is sliping praise into the secondary part of your point, putting it in vebal parentheses. Try It. Youll Like It. Theyll Love It. Try Accidental Adulation and see smiles break out on the faces of the recipients. Tell your sixty-five-year-old uncle, Anyone as fit as you would have zipped right up those steps, but boy, was I out of breath. Tell a colleague: Because youre so knowledgeable in contract law, you would have read between the lines, but stupidly, I signed it. You run the danger, of course, that you will please the reciient so profoundly with your parenthetical praise, he or she wont hear your main point. So far we have explored four covert compliments: Grapevine Glory, Carrier Pigeon Kudos, Implied Magnificence, and Accdental Adulation. There are times, of course, when blatant praise does work. The next techniques will hone your skills in this prcarious but rewarding venture. Technique #54 Accidental Adulation Become an undercover complimenter. Stealthily sneak praise into the parenthetical part of your sentence. Just dont try to quiz anyone later on your main point. The joyful jolt of your accidental adulation strikes them temporarily deaf to anything that follows. How to Make Em Never Forget You with a Killer Compliment Would you like to have a little trick up your sleeve potent enough to kick start commerce, ignite a friendship or even a love affair? Ill give you one, but only if you heed its warning label. You must register your tongue as a lethal weapon once youve mastered the following technique. Its called the Killer Compliment. It was born one night some years ago after my then-roommate, Christine, and I had just returned home from a holiday party. As we were taking off our coats, she had a silly smile on her face and a faraway look in her eye. Christine, are you OK? I asked. Oh yes, she purred. Im going to go out with that man. Man? What man? Oh, you know, she said, chastising me for not knowing, the one who told me I had beautiful teeth. Teeth! That night I happened to walk by the bathroom door as Christine was getting ready for bed. I saw her grinning at herself in the mirror, tilting her head from side to side, and brushing each individual tooth. All the while she kept her eyes glued to the miror, inspecting each one for the beauty her new admirer comented on. I realized the fellow who had given Christine the 211 unusual compliment had made her dayand had made a killer impression on her. Thus the Killer Compliment came into being. What is the Killer Compliment? It is commenting on some very personal and specific quality you spot in someone. A Killer Compliment is not I like your tie or Youre a very nice person. (The first is not personal enough and the second is not specific enough.) A Killer Compliment is more like What exquisite eyes you have, (very specific) or You have a wonderful air of honesty about you, (very personal). Because delivering your first Killer Compliment is difficult, I trick my seminar participants into pulling it off. About midway through the program, Ill ask them to close their eyes and think about a partner they had in an earlier exercise. Then I say, Now recall one attractive physical quality or personality trait you observed in your partner. Not one you would necessarily comment on, I caution. Perhaps your partner had a lovely smile or a twikle in her eye. Perhaps he exuded a sense of calm or credibility. Got it in your mind? Then the thunderbolt: OK, now go find your partner and tell them the nice quality you noticed. What? Tell them? The thought paralyzes them. One by one, however, they courageously seek their partners and deliver their Killer Compliments. As peple hear a stranger tell them they have beautiful hands or pentrating brown eyes, joy fills the room. Laughter explodes in every corner. I am now looking out at a sea of smiles and happy blushes. Everyone loves receiving his or her personal Killer Compliment. And everyone develops friendly feelings toward the giver. The Killer Compliment Users Manual Just like a cannon, if you dont use the Killer Compliment corectly, it can backfire. Heres the users manual that comes with the mighty missile. How to Make Em Never Forget You with a Killer Compliment 213 Technique #55 Killer Compliment Whenever you are talking with a stranger youd like to make part of your professional or personal future, search for one attractive, specific, and unique quality he or she has. At the end of the conversation, look the individual right in the eye. Say his or her name and proceed to curl all ten toes with the Killer Compliment. Rule #1: Deliver your Killer Compliment to the recipent in private. If you are standing with a group of four or five people and you praise one woman for being fit, every other woman feels like a barrel of lard. If you tell one man he has wonderful carriage, every other feels like a hunchback. You also make the blushing recipient uncomfortable. Rule #2: Make your Killer Compliment credible. For example, Im tone-deaf. If Im forced to sing even a simple song like Happy Birthday, I sound like a sick pig. If anyone in earshot were foolish enough to tell me they liked my voice, Id know it was hogwash. Rule #3: Confer only one Killer Compliment per half year on each recipient. Otherwise you come across as insincere, groveling, obsequious, pandering, and a thoroughly manipulative person. Not cool. With careful aim, the Killer Compliment captures everyone. It works best, however, when you use it judiciously on new acquaintances. If you want to praise friends every day, employ the next technique. How to Make Em Smile with Itty-Bitty Boosters In contrast to the big guns of Killer Compliments for strangers, and The Tombstone Game for loved ones, which we will learn shortly, heres a little peashooter you can pop off at anyone, antime. I call it Little Strokes. Little Strokes are short, quick kudos you drop into your casual conversation. Make liberal use of Little Strokes with your coleagues in the office: Nice job, John! Well done, Kyoto! Hey, not bad, Billy! I have one friend who uses a lovely Little Stroke. If I do something he likes, he says, Not too shabby, Leil. You can also use Little Strokes on the everyday achievements of your loved ones. If your spouse just cooked a great meal, Wow, youre the best chef in town. Just before going out together, Gee, honey, you look great. After a long drive, You did it! It must have been tiring. With your kids, Hey, gang, great job cleaning up your room. I once read a poignant Readers Digest article about a little girl who often misbehaved. Her mother had to continually reprimand her. However, one day, the little girl had been especially good and 214 How to Make Em Smile with Itty-Bitty Boosters 215 hadnt done a single thing that called for a reprimand. The mother said, That night after I tucked her in bed and started downstairs, I heard a muffled noise. Running back up, I found her head buried in the pillow. She was sobbing. Between the sobs she asked, Mommy, havent I been a pretty good girl today? The question, the mother said, went through her like a knife. I had been quick to correct her, she said, when she was wrong. But when she tried to behave, I hadnt noticed it and I put her to bed without one word of appreciation. Adults are all grown-up little girls and little boys. We may not go to bed sobbing if the people in our lives dont notice when we are good. Nevertheless, a trace of those tears lingers. Little Things Mean a Lot Little Strokes are indeed, little. But as every woman knows, they mean a lot. Ive yet to meet a woman who wouldnt agree with these lyrics from an old song sung by Kitty Kallen: Blow me a kiss from across the room. Say I look nice when Im not. Touch my hair as you pass my chair. Technique #56 Little Strokes Dont make your colleagues, your friends, your loved ones look at you and silently say, Havent I been pretty good today? Let them know how much you appreciate them by caressing them with verbal Little Strokes like Nice job! Well done! Cool! 216 How to Talk to Anyone Little things mean a lot. Send me the warmth of a secret smile To show me you havent forgot. For always and ever, now and forever, Little things mean a lot. To further complicate the art of the compliment, one must consider timing. Blatant, barefaced, brazen flattery turns all but the blindest egomaniacs off. But the human animal never fails to amaze observers. There are moments when, if you dont give a bltant, barefaced, brazen complimenteven to a bright indiviualyou lose. The following technique defines those moments. How to Praise with Perfect Timing Ill never forget the first time I gave a luncheon speech in front of strangers. Id practiced for the stuffed animals on my bed and my roommate, Christine, but this was my debut in front of a real audience. As I shakily got to my feet, I looked out at seventeen smiling Rotarians waiting for my words of wit and wisdom. My tongue was dry as chalk dust, my palms as wet as a fish. The audience might as well have been seventeen thousand judges waiting to setence me to eternal humiliation if I didnt inform and entertain each. I gave a last panic-stricken glance at Christine, who had driven me to the club, and began, Good afternoon. It gives me great pleasure . . . Thirty minutes later, amidst scattered applause which I feared was obligatory, I crawled back to my seat next to Christine. I looked expectantly at her. She smiled and said, You know this dessert isnt bad. Have some. Dessert? Dessert! Dammit, Christine, how did I do? I silently screamed at her. A few minutes later Christine told me how much she and, she assumed, everyone else enjoyed my talk. Neertheless, by then it was too late. The crucial compliment-craving moment had passed. 217 Quick as a Hiccup, You Must Compliment NOW When the doctor sadistically smacks your knee with that nasty litle rubber hammer, you instantly give a knee jerk. And when peple make a coup, you must instantly hit them with a knee-jerk Wow, you were great! Say theyve just successfully negotiated a deal, cooked a terific Thanksgiving turkey, or sung a solo song at the birthday party. No matter whether their accomplishment is trivial or triumphant, you must praise it immediatelynot ten minutes later, not two minutes laterimmediately. The moment the winner walks out of the boardroom, the kitchen, the spotlight, the victor wants to hear only one sound: WOW! But What If They Really Bombed? Are you asking me to lie? you ask. Yes. Absolutely, positively, resoundingly, YES. This is one of the few moments in life where a lie is condoned by the most ethical individuals. Big winners reaize that sensitivity to an insecure performers ego takes mometary precedence over their deep commitment to the truth. They Technique #57 The Knee-Jerk Wow! Quick as a blink, you must praise people the moment they a finish a feat. In a wink, like a knee-jerk reaction say, You were terrific! Dont worry that they wont believe you. The euphoria of the moment has a strangely numbing effect on the achievers objective judgment. How to Praise with Perfect Timing 219 also know, when sanity returns to the recipient and they suspect they screwed up, it wont matter. He or she will retroactively apprciate your sensitivity and forgive your compassionate falsehood. Weve talked a lot about giving compliments, both covert and overt. Now lets talk about a skill that, for many, is even harder receiving them. How to Make Em Want to Compliment You We have a national weakness: we dont know how to receive a compliment! In fact, I would like to dedicate the following tecnique to my French friends who contend the French are better at everything. Well, I concede one point. The French are, indeed, better at receiving compliments. Ill explain how shortly. Americans, unfortunately, are beastly at accepting adulation. If someone compliments you and you react clumsily out of embarassment, you unwittingly start a vicious cycle. A friend ventures a compliment: He: (smiling) Hey, thats a nice dress youre wearing. She: (frowning) Oh, this old thing? He: (thinking) Whoops, she didnt seem to like hearing that. She thinks I have terrible taste to like that dress. Id better keep my mouth shut. Three weeks later . . . She: (thinking grumpily) He doesnt ever give me complments anymore. What a boor! He: (thinking gloomily) Whats her problem? 220 How to Make Em Want to Compliment You 221 Girls Dont Like What? Several months ago in one of my seminars, the group was dicussing compliments. One fellow insisted that girls dont like compliments. Girls dont like what? I asked incredulously. He explained, I once told a woman she had beautiful eyes. And she said, Boy, are you blind. The poor chap was so wounded by her reaction, he became gun-shy and had not aimed a compliment at a female since. What a shame for womankind and what a blight on his social skills. Upon receiving a compliment, many people demur or proffer an embarrassed little Thank you. Worse, they protest, Well, not really, but thanks anyway. Some people toss it off with, just luck. When you react this way, you visit a grave injustice on the coplimenter. You insult a well-meaning persons powers of perception. Vous ætes Gentil Leave it to French folks to come up with a congenial catchall phrase. Upon receiving a compliment, they say, Vous �tes gentil. Loosely translated, that is How kind of you. An American saying How kind of you could sound stilted like the little flower girl in My Fair Lady trying to be cultured. Nevertheless, we Yanks can express the French gentil sentiment with a technique I call Boomeranging. When you toss a boomerang, it makes an almost 180-degree swerve in midair and soars back to land at the feet of the thrower. Likewise, when someone tosses a compliment your way, let the good feelings soar back to the tosser. Dont just say Thanks. (Or worse, Oh its nothing.) Let them know of your gratitude and find a way to compliment them for their compliment. A few examples: She says, I like those shoes. You say, Oh Im so happy you told me. I just got them. He says, You really did a good job on this project. You say, Oh, thats so nice of you to tell me. I appreciate your positive feedback. You can also Boomerang the good feelings back when people ask you a question about your family, a project, an event, or anthing that shows they are interested in you. Your colleague asks, How was your vacation in Hawaii? You answer, Oh, you remembered I went to Hawaii! It was great, thanks. Your boss asks, Are you over your cold now? You answer, I appreciate your concern. I feel much better now. Whenever someone shines a little sunshine on your life in the form of a compliment or concerned question, reflect it back on the shiner. Incidently, in that seminar, I decided to do womankind a favor by setting malekind straight on compliments once and for all. I asked the fellow who swore women hated praise to give three women sitting near him a sincere compliment. He chose the woman with the beautiful silver hair sitting behind him, the girl Technique #58 Boomeranging Just as a boomerang flies right back to the thrower, let compliments boomerang right back to the giver. Like the French, quickly murmur something that expresses Thats very kind of you. How to Make Em Want to Compliment You 223 with the hands like a pianist to his left, and the lady with the lovely deep-blue eyes on his right. He told them all. Three women waltzed out of the room that night feeling a litle better about themselves than when they walked in. And, I hope, for all the women he would yet meet in his life, one man left with a changed attitude about compliments. As we come to the end of our exploration of praise, I want to make sure youre aiming dead center for peoples hearts. Whether youre giving little Carrier Pigeon Kudos or laying a Killer Copliment on your conversation partner, this next technique keeps you on target. How to Make a Loved One Feel You Are THE Partner for Life Do you remember when you were a kid the hundreds of times Mommys and Daddys friends asked, And what do you want to be when you grow up? That was our cue to regale our adoring audience with dreams of being a ballerina, a firefighter, a nurse, a cowboy, or a movie star. Well, most of our lives wound up being a little closer to butcher, baker, or candlestick maker. Neverthless, we all still have fantasies of our own greatness. Even though most of us cashed in our childhood dreams of being the star we thought wed be (so we could make some money), we all know that deep down we are very, very, very sp cial. We say to ourselves, Maybe the world will little note nor long remember how brilliant, how wonderful, how witty, how creative or caring I really am. However, those who truly know and love methey will recognize my greatness, my magic, my specialness over all other ordinary mortals. When we find people with the supernatural powers of perception to recognize our remarkablness, we become addicted to the heady drug of their appreciation. Praising someone you know and love requires a different set of skills from complimenting a stranger. The formula to bring someone even closer to you personally or professionally follows. I call it The Tombstone Game. It requires a little setup. 224 How to Make a Loved One Feel You Are THE Partner for Life 225 Step one: In a quiet moment chatting with your friend, your loved one, or your business partner, tell him or her that the other day you were reading aboutof all thingstombstones! The piece was about, you say, what people fantasize will be inscribed above their grave after they die. You learned that people want the quality they are most proud of in life etched in stone. Then say, The variety is surprising. Everyone has a different self-image, a different deep source of pride. Examples: Here lies John Doe. He was a brilliant scientist. Here lies Diane Smith. She was a caring woman. Here lies Billy Bucks. By golly, he could make people laugh. Here lies Jane Wilson. She spread joy wherever she went. Here lies Harry Jones. He lived life his way. Step two: Reveal to your partner what you would like carved on your tombstone. Be serious about your revelation to encourage him or her to do likewise. Step three: Now, you pop the question, You know, Joe, when all is said and done, what are you most proud of ? What would you like the world to most remember about you? What would you want the world to see carved on your tombstone? Perhaps your business partner Joe says, Well, I guess Id sort of like people to know that Im a man of my word. Listen carfully. If he expounds on it, take note of every nuance. Then file it away in your heart and dont say a word about it again. Joe will forget you ever played The Tombstone Game with him. Step four: Let at least three weeks pass. Then, whenever you want to improve the relationship, feed the information back to your partner in the form of a compliment. Say Joe, you know the reason I really appreciate being in business with you is because youre a man of your word. WOW, that hits Joe like a 747 out of the sky. Finally, he says to himself, someone who appreciates me for who I really am. Telling him you admire him for the same reason he admires himself has an impact on Joe like no other compliment in the world. Now, suppose your friend is Billy Bucks, the one who wanted his wit carved on his tombstone. Youd say, Billy, ol buddy, youre terrific. I loves ya cause you can really make people laugh. I Love You Because . . . (You Fill in the Blank) Suppose your significant other is Jane Wilson in the preceding example. Tell your beloved, Jane, I love you because you spread joy wherever you go. Suppose your life partner is Harry Jones. You take his hand and say, Harry, I love you because you live life your way. BLAM! You have found that tender spot where the heart and the ego blend. Technique #59 The Tombstone Game Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but dont mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say I appreciate you or I love you, fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier. You take peoples breath away when you feed their deepest self-image to them in a compliment. At last, they say to themselves, someone who loves me for who I truly am. How to Make a Loved One Feel You Are THE Partner for Life 227 The Tombstone Game compliments are not interchangeable. Billy Bucks might not appreciate your calling him a man of his word; Billys thing is humor. Jane might not value your thinking she lives life her way. Her source of pride is spreading joy wheever she goes. Its wonderful to tell people you appreciate or love them. When it matches what they appreciate or love about themselves, the effect is overpowering.",

        "text": "PART SEVEN How to Direct Dial Their Hearts Hundreds of people have formed impressions of you through that little device on your desk, your bed table, your kitchen wall. And theyve never actually met you. Theyve never seen your smiles, felt your frowns. Theyve never grasped your hand or enjoyed your hugs. Theyve never read your body language or seen how you dress. Everything they know about you came through tiny filments, sometimes from hundreds of miles away. But they feel they know you just from the sound of your voice. Thats how poweful the telephone is. Powerful, yes, but not always accurate. For years I dealt with my travel agent only by phone. Rani, my faceless agent whom Id never met in person, got me rock-bottom prices on airfares, cars, and hotels. But her snippy phone personality really ticked me off. A dozen times I vowed to find another agent. One Monday morning several years ago, I received bad news and had to book an immediate flight home for a family emergency. I had no time to wait in line at the airport, so I jumped in a cab and asked the driver to wait in front of the travel agency while I grabbed tickets and a boarding pass. Like a lit fuse, I zipped into Ranis agency for the first time. Seeing my frenzied rush, the woman sitting at the front desk sypathetically jumped up. She gave me a reassuring smile and asked 229 how she could help me. As I blithered on about my need for an emergency ticket, she smiled, nodded, and lunged immediately into action. What a terrific lady! I thought as she printed out the tickets. Moments later, darting out gratefully grasping the tickets in my fist, I called out over my shoulder, By the way, whats your name? Leil, Im Rani, she said. I whirled around and saw a thooughly congenial woman with a big smile on her face waving to wish me a safe trip. I was dumbfounded! Why had I previously thought she was so snippy? Rani was, well, so nice. Sitting back in the cab on the way to the airport, I figured it all out. Ranis friendlinessher warm smile, her nods, her good eye contact, her body language, her Im here for you attitude were all silent signals that didnt travel through wires. I closed my eyes and tried to remember the voice I had heard moments ago. Yes, it was Ranis same crisp, curt pronunciation. But her friendly body language made her seem like a different person from the brusque agent Id dealt with on the phone. Ranis phone persoality and her demeanor in person were completely different shows. I realized its the same with all of us. Your personality, mine, and everyones could be likened to a show, a theatrical perfomance. You want to make sure yours is a box-office smash, not a flop. The following ten techniques will get your phone personaity rave reviews. How to Sound More Exciting on the Phone I have a friend, Tina, who designed costumes for an off-ofBroadway show that became a smash hit a few years ago. The tiny show was such a critical success, it won the heart of an angel a backerand it went to Broadway. There the show laid a big fat egg. When I read the bad news, I called Tina. Tina, why did the show get such bad reviews on Broadway? Tina told me that, sadly, the director didnt insist the actors and actresses change their peformances to adapt to the new surroundings. The actors undestated movements, which moved small audiences alternately to laughter and tears, were lost in the big Broadway house. Audiences couldnt see their subtle gestures and poignant facial expressions. Tina told me the performers neglected to make their movements much bigger to fit the new medium. That excellent advice is not just for actors. Whenever you are talking, you must consider your medium. If your face were on a big movie screen, you might get your message across with a wink or an eyebrow raise. On radio, however, that would be meaninless. Because listeners couldnt see your wink, youd have to say something like Hi, Cutie. Because listeners couldnt see your raised eyebrows, youd have to say, Wow, Im surprised! 231 Your body language and facial expressions comprise more than half your personality. When people dont see you, they can get an entirely wrong impression as I did with Rani. To get your persoality across on the phone, you must translate your emotions into sound. In fact, you have to exaggerate the sound because studies have shown people lose 30 percent of the energy level in their voices on the phone. Say you meet an important new contact tomorrow. When youre introduced, you shake her hand, you fully face her. You make good, strong eye contact and let a sincere smile flood over your face. You even nod and smile, listening intently as she speaks. She likes you a lot. But how good an impression could you make on that VIP if both you and she were blindfolded and the two of you had your hands tied behind your backs? Thats the handicap you suffer on the phone. If she couldnt see you, youd have to substitute words to let her know youre agreeing or listening. Youd have to somehow vebalize that youre smiling and use her name more to replace the eye contact. Youd be using the technique I call Talking Gestures. To make up for your missing eye contact, punctuate your phone conversations with Uh huh or I hear you. So your litener knows youre nodding in approval, verbalize I see, Oh thats great, No kidding, Interesting, and Tell me more! She didnt see you hitting your head in surprise? Better say What a surprise! or You dont say! He just said something impressive and he cant see your look of admiration? Try That was wise of you or Youre no dummy! Of course, you need a big verbal smile in your repertoire. Try Oh, wow, thats funny! Obviously youre going to choose phrases that match your personality and the situation. Just make sure your phone listeners hear your emotions. How to Sound More Exciting on the Phone 233 Technique #60 Talking Gestures Think of yourself as the star of a personal radio drama every time you pick up the phone. If you want to come across as engaging as you are, you must turn your smiles into sound, your nods into noise, and all your gestures into something your listener can hear. You must replace your gestures with talk. Then punch up the whole act 30 percent! How to Sound Close (Even if Youre Hundreds of Miles Away) When youre not sitting across from each other resting your elbows on the same desk, your forks on the same table, or your heads on the same pillow, you need a substitute for intimacy. How can you create closeness when the two of you are hundreds of miles apart? How can you make the person youre talking to on the phone feel special when you cant pat their back or give them a little hug? The answer is simple. Just use your callers name far more often than you would in person. In fact, shower your converstions with his or her name. When your listener hears it, its like receiving a verbal caress: Thanks, Sam. Lets do it, Betty. Hey, Demetri, why not? Its really been good talking to you, Kathi. Saying a persons name too often in face-to-face conversation sounds manipulative. However, on the phone the effect is drmatically different. If you heard someone say your name, even if you were being jostled around in a big noisy crowd, youd perk up 234 How to Sound Close (Even if Youre Hundreds of Miles Away) 235 and listen. Likewise, when your phone partner hears his or her own name coming through the receiver, it commands attention and rcreates the familiarity the phone robs from you. If your listener is drifting, it brings him right back. If shes opening mail, she stops. If hes picking his teeth, he pulls the pick out. When you say someones name on the phone, its like yaning the person into the room with you. Technique #61 Name Shower People perk up when they hear their own name. Use it more often on the phone than you would in person to keep their attention. Your callers name re-creates the eye contact, the caress, you might give in person. Saying someones name repeatedly when face-to-face sounds pandering. But because there is physical distance between you on the phonesometimes youre a contnent apartyou can spray your conversation with it. How to Make Em Happy They Called You Brr-ing! No matter whether you hear the ring in the boardroom, the bedroom, or the bathroom, self-styled telephone experts tell you, Smile before answering. Some pros even suggest you perch a mirror right next to your phone to monitor your grin. Been there, done that, doesnt work. One evening, in the midle of my weekly mud-pack facial, the phone rang. The horror of seeing myself in the phone mirror made my voice as hideous as my face. I immediately trashed the pros advice along with the miror. Who wants to sound like a dizzy Pollyanna? A no-brain Cheshire cat? A lonely recluse whose life is so dull that the big thrill of the day is a phone call? Any phone call? From anybody! Big winners dont smile before answering. They put a smile in their voices after they hear who is on the line. Thats when it counts. Answer the phone unemotionally, professionally. Say your name or the name of your company. Then when you hear who is on the line, the little trick is to let a big smile flood over your face. Oh Joe, [smile] how nice to hear from you! Sally, [smile] how are you? Bill, [smile] I was hoping it would be you. My friend Steve lives in Washington, D.C., and heads a major trade association that lobbies on Capitol Hill. Whenever I call Steve, I never know which of his dozens of assistants is going to 236 How to Make Em Happy They Called You 237 answer. Nevertheless, whoever answers gives me the same warm response. First he or she says, Cable Telecommunications Association, the individuals name, and How may I direct your call? No fake friendliness. No prefab smiles in the voice. I am sure the assistant is not beaming back at hior herself in any mirror. When I say Is Mr. Effros available? This is Leil Lowndes caling, thats when the employee becomes superfriendly. Oh yes, Ms. Lowndes, he or she purrs. Definitely! Let me put you right through. Wow, does that make me feel special! As Im waiting for Steve to come to the phone, I fantasize him sitting at the head of a long mahogany table in his weekly staff meeting. I can just hear him instructing his staff, Now if the president or some higher-ups in the White House call, put them right through. Oh, and of course, if that important woman Leil Lowndes calls, put her right through, too. While visiting Washington last year, I had lunch with Steve. I took the opportunity to tell him what a pleasure it was to call his office and how I appreciated his staff s warm phone reception. I thanked him for familiarizing each with my name and metioning I might be calling from time to time. Steve looked across the table at me and blinked. Leil, he said, you teach telephone skills. Havent you caught on? Huh? Forgive me if Im bursting a bubble, Steve said, but everone gets that reception, no matter whos calling. Oh! When a Pain in the Neck Calls But Steve, I protested when Id recuperated from the initial diappointment that I was a victim of a technique and not a VIP, what if the caller is unknown, a complete stranger? Surely your staffers shouldnt fake they know the caller. Of course not, Leil. In that case, I instruct them to show energy and enthusiasm over the reason theyre calling. For exaple, suppose the caller is a cable operator wanting to join our assciation. The caller would get a smile and a sincere, Oh yes, Mr. Smith, Ill put you right through. Yeah, but suppose the caller is selling office furniture? I challenged. Doesnt matter, Steve said. The salesperson gets the same reception after the staffer hears why hes calling. If my staffer says warmly, Oh, office furniture! the caller feels good. And I find the salesperson is a lot easier to deal with later. I told him, OK, Steve, starting tomorrow morning, Im going to put that Oh wow, Im so happy you called for that reason atttude in my voice. The next morning, the first call was my dentists office. Ms. Lowndes, this call is to remind you youre overdue for your simonth checkup. Oh, of course, youre so right, I cooed. Im so glad you called. The receptionist sounded surprised but very pleased at my reaction. I cant book an appointment right now, I continued, but Ill call you as soon as my schedule frees up. She didnt hasle me with her usual Well, when do you expect that to be? She just hung up satisfied. (And I got what I wantedno call from my dentists office for at least another six months.) The second time the phone rang, it was a man who had ordered my tape set calling to complain that one of the tapes broke. Oh my goodness, Im so glad you told me about that, I said with the enthusiasm of having won the lottery. The caller sounded a little shocked but obviously pleased at my reaction. Of course, Ill get another set out to you and I hope you accept my apologies. Caller hung up satisfied. (And I got what I wanted How to Make Em Happy They Called You 239 his good will and word of mouth in spite of my tape duplicators blooper.) The third call was tougher. This was from a vendor I had copletely forgotten to pay. Oh, Im so glad you reminded me of that bill, I lied. Again, shocked pleasure was the callers reaction. (I was probably the first creditor in history who ever sounded happy shed called.) In the back of my mind I felt there was one bill I had overlooked. Im writing the check as we speak. Then I got my reward. The dunner said, By the way, dont worry about the 2 percent per month late-payment charge. As long as we get your check by the end of the week, it will be OK. She hung up happy. (And I got a presentno finance charges in spite of my oversight.) And so it went throughout the rest of the day, the rest of the week, and ever since. Try it. Youll find you get a lot more from anone when you smile, after you find out who it is or why theyre caling. Use the Oh Wow, Its You! technique on almost every call. Technique #62 Oh Wow, Its You! Dont answer the phone with an Im just sooo happy all the time attitude. Answer warmly, crisply, and professionally. Then, after you hear who is calling, let a huge smile of happiness engulf your entire face and spill over into your voice. You make your caller feel as though your giant warm fuzzy smile is reserved for him or her. How to Sneak Past the Gatekeeper No, No, Aaaaaagh, not The Screen! Picture a torture device called The Screen. The mad scientist, laughing maniacally, forces the victim into a giant meat grinder that mashes him through a heavy-metal screen. It slices his body into a million moecules before hes reconstituted on the other side. Being screened when you call someones office is the emotional version of that ordeal. You place your cold call. May I speak to Mr. Jones? you pleasantly ask. Whos calling? a haughty voice responds. Of course, your name is not prestigious enough for the screener to grant you the exalted status of speaking to Jones. Her ruthless interrogation continues, And what company are you with? You submit your companys name, praying it will score with her. And then to top it off, she has the pluck to ask, And whats this in reference to? Aaaaaagh! Several weeks after my luncheon with Steve, I had the occsion to call him again. Is Steve Effros available? This is Leil Lowdes calling. 240 How to Sneak Past the Gatekeeper 241 Oh yes, Ms. Lowndes, definitely. Let me put you right through. I start humming happily as I wait for Steve to come to the line. A moment later his assistant came back and said sympathetcally, Im so sorry, Ms. Lowndes. Steve just stepped out to lunch. I know hell be sorry he missed your call. Meanwhile, Im still smiling. Do I suspect that Steve didnt just step out to lunch? Do I suspect hes sitting right there? Do I ever, in my wildest parnoid dreams, think he doesnt have the time or inclination to talk to me? Do I feel screened? No way! Im as happy as a carefree kiten as I leave my number for a callback. You see, I have probably fallen for The Sneaky Screen. Technique #63 The Sneaky Screen If you must screen your calls, instruct your staff to first say cheerfully, Oh yes, Ill put you right through. May I tell her whos calling? If the party has already identified himself, its Oh of course, Mr. Whoozit. Ill put you right through. When the secretary comes back with the bad news that Mr. or Ms. Bigwig is unavailable, callers dont take it personally and never feel screened. They fall for it every time, just like I did. How to Get What You Want on the Phone from Big Shots I know a secret about a big cat who owns an international hotel chain with properties in six countries. He hires and fires thosands, awards or pulls immense contracts, borrows from major financial institutions, and makes lavish contributions to charities. Mr. Big Cat (well call him Ed) has a respected and immediately recognizable name in his industry. And heres the secret: Mrs. Big Cat is the real brains behind the operation. I became friends with Mrs. Big Cat (well call her Sylvia) when I did some consulting for her husbands organization. Sylvia invited me to tea one afternoon. She sweetly apologized that this was maids day off so wed have to fend for ourselves. As we hapily perched ourselves on the patio and were about to dive into our tea and crumpets, the phone rang. She excused herself to answer it. I heard Mrs. Big Cat say, No, Im sorry, hes not in. Shall I tell him who called? . . . No, I dont know when he is planning on returning, but if you give me your name and . . . No, I said I dont know what time hell be back . . . Yes, Ill tell him you called. As Sylvia returned to the patio, I could she was annoyed by the call. Always on the lookout for a good phone story, I ventured a questioning look. 242 How to Get What You Want on the Phone from Big Shots 243 Picking up on my curiosity, she said, That fool thinks hes going to get a contribution from Ed. Ha! she laughed wryly. Her candor emboldened me to ask her more. It turns out the caller, a Mr. Creighton, was a fund-raiser for a major charity Ed was cosidering contributing to. My hostess said Creighton had called twice in the past two weeks when Ed was out. And not once did he greet me, ask how I was, or apologize for the disturbance. This did not please Mrs. Big Cat. Was it a major irritation for Mrs. Big Cat? No, only minor. But did it mean a major loss for the little cat who called? It sure did. In Ed and Sylvia Big Cats household, subtleties count. At the dinner table, Mrs. Big Cat could say to her husband, A very nice man named Creighton called for you today, dear. Or she might say, A rather irritating chap named Creighton called for you today. One comment or the other could mean millions won or lost by Creightons charity. And all because little cat Creighton mildly ruffled Mrs. Big Cats whiskers. Home advice: Salute the Spouse. Office advice: Salute the Secretary. A surprising number of Big Cat spousesand secretaries have deep claws into important business decisions. When it comes Technique #64 Salute the Spouse Whenever you are calling someones home, always identify and greet the person who answers. Whenever you call someones office more than once or twice, make friends with the secretary. Anybody who is close enough to answer the phone is close enough to sway the VIPs opinion of you. hiring time, firing time, promoting time, or buying time, many spouses have a say. When it comes to whose calls get through, whose proposals get put on the top of the bosss desk, who gets luncheon appointments made, secretaries opinions count! Only foolish callers dont realize all spouses and secretaries have names. All spouses and secretaries have lives. All spouses and secretaries have feelings. All spouses and secretaries have influence. Deal accordingly. How to Get What You Wantby Timing! When Alexander Graham Bell invented the phone, he and his comrades had no use for such trite phrases as Hi, how ya doin? Bell and his boys never just started spouting their ideas into their listeners ears. The first words out of their mouths in those times were Can you talk? Bell and his buddies were, of course, refering to technical capabilities. Little did they know, more than a hundred years later, big winners would use a form of that same greeting. Today, of course, Can you talk? means Is it convenient to talk? Before launcing into conversation, they always ask Is this a good time to chat? Did I catch you at a good time? Do you have a minute to dicuss the widget account? All folks have a Big Ben in their brain that determines how receptive they are going to be to you and your ideas. When you mess with their internal cuckoo clock, they wont listen to you. No matter how interesting your information, or how pleasant your call, bad timing means bad results for you. Its not your fault. Whenever you call someone at home, you never know whether she was sleeping or whether theres a fire raing in the kitchen stove. Whenever you call someone at work, you 245 never know whether hes got two hours to get a report in or whether the big boss is not-so-patiently sitting on his desk. Whenever you place a call, alwaysnot occasionally, not frquentlyalways ask about your timing. Make it a habit. Make it a rule. Make it a self-punishable crime if the first words out of your mouth dont concern the convenience of your timing: Hi, Joe, is this a good time to talk? Hello, Susan. Have you got a minute? Hi, Carl, did I catch you good or did I catch you bad? Sam, do you have a second for me to tell you about what happened at the game last Saturday? There are many ways to say it, but it all boils down to Is this a good time to talk? My friend Barry, a broadcaster, accomplishes more in a day than most people do in a week. He came up with a clever coversational device that ensures hell never shatter anyones emtional sundial. He calls it What Color Is Your Time? Barry introduces the device by telling people hes calling he has great respect for their time. He then asks permission to start his future conversations with a question that assures hell never disturb them at an inopportune moment. Barry says hes going to ask what color their time is. They should honestly answer, red, yellow, or green. Red means Im really rushed. Yellow means Im busy but whats on your mind? If its quick, we can deal with it. Green means Sure, Ive got time. Lets talk. Red, like the stoplight at the corner, means stop. Yellow means hurry up, time is short or stop and wait for the next green light. Green means go. Busy people pick up quickly on his artful device and enjoy the game. Most especially, they enjoy Barrys sensitivity and respect for their time. In fact, he says, most of his callers play the same How to Get What You Wantby Timing! 247 sensitive game when they call him. Hi Barry, what color is your time? Are you green? Salesfolks, Wait for the Green Light A note here for salespeople. If you ask a prospect if he or she has time to talk and the answer is Not really, but tell me whats on your mind, DONT! Do not make your sales pitch while he or she is red. Do not talk when he or she is yellow. Wait until green, very green. (If you ever want to see any green coming from your prospect, that is.) Technique #65 What Color Is Your Time? No matter how urgent you think your call, always begin by asking the person about timing. Either use the What Color Is Your Time? device or simply ask, Is this a convenient time for you to talk? When you ask about timing first, youll never smash your footprints right in the middle of your telephone partners sands of time. Youll never get a No! just because your timing wasnt right. How to Impress Everyone with Your Outgoing Voicemail Message You can tell a lot about people just from the outgoing messages they leave on their voice mail. Hello, his machine answers. Im not in right now. But you probably dont want to talk to me anway. Beep. Would you suspect this fellow has an inferiority complex? Hello, her machine answers. The sound you hear is the barking of our killer Doberman pinscher, Wolf. Please leave a mesage after the tone. Beep. Would you suspect this woman is woried about break-ins? Most of us dont record our personal foibles so conspicuously for the world to hear. Nevertheless, people can hear a lot between the lines of what we say on our voice mail. Last month I needed a graphic artist to do some work for one of my extremely conservative clients. I phoned Mark, an artist whose work I had seen and liked a lot. His answering machine blasted ear-splitting rock music through the receiver. Then his voice boomed over the electric guitar, Hey there, dude, dont be crude. Jes croon me an earful of sweeeeeeet sounds right at that lone tone. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Beep. I banged the receiver quickly 248 How to Impress Everyone with Your Outgoing Voicemail Message 249 back into the cradle to shut out horrible fantasies of how my client would react if he had to call Mark. His thirty-second talent show might have been an appropriate sample of a rock musicians taent. But a businessperson should opt for a more sedate outgoing message. The message you leave on your answering machine reflects your work. Keep yours friendly, neutral, and up-to-date. And heres the secret: to give the impression you are really on top of your business, change your message every day. Studies show that callers perceive people to be brighter and more efficient when they hear an updated message each time they call. If appropriate, let callers know where you are and when you intend to be back. If you have customers who need to be attended to, this is crucial. Try something like this on your office phone: This is (name). Its Thursday, May 7, and Ill be in a sales meeting until late this afternoon. Please leave your message and Ill get back to you as soon as I return. That way, if you dont call a client back until 4 p.m. he isnt steaming. Also, keep it short. Some people change their message every day, but its too long. I had a colleague, a public speaker named Dan, who in his finest mellifluous voice imposed his thought for the day on all unsuspecting callers. Last year I was working on a project with Dan and had to call him three times in the same day to leave a progress report. Each time his machine answered: Hello, this is Dan, and heres my daily motivator. He cleared his throat for his big recorded peformance and then continued. Did someone say something today that offended you? So what! Thats their problem. He paused drmatically. Did someone look at you the wrong way? So what! Thats their problem. Again, a pause for the magnitude of that sentiment to sink in. Replace your petty thoughts of anger, exaperation, and spite with thoughts of strength. Calm down. Rise above those little insignificant irritations in life. Focus your thoughts in the direction of fulfillment and accomplishment. Once again, this is Dan. Im surprised he didnt also leave his agents phone number here. Leave your message at the tone. And have a great peaceful day. Beep. The first time I listened to Dans inspirational message, the length mildly irritated me. The second time, I found myself hypeventilating while waiting for him to get through his unbearably long message. By the third call, his schmaltzy message seemed interminable. I was filled with those petty thoughts of anger, exaperation, and spite he warned against because of his darn mesage. I found it impossible to rise above it and focus my thoughts in the direction of fulfillment and accomplishment. I wanted to punch him in the nose. Outgoing messages are not the venues to give inspirational messages or to impress the world with ones accomplishments. Another friend of mine, a writer, earned herself a few little cat stripes with this one on her machine: Hello, this is Cheryl Smith. Cheryl is on her national book tour, (she paused so all callers could be appropriately impressed) making appearances in twelve cities. (Another pause as though awaiting applause.) Shell be returning on October 7. (Whats this she bit? Cheryl herself is speaking.) Please leave your mesage for her at the tone. Beep. Yes, Cheryl, we know youre an important author. But your third-party reference to self, your narcissistic tone of voice, and topping it off with twelve cities would make any big cat snicker through his whiskers. One last codicil: Avoid one particular message many busnesspeople use these daysIm either away from my desk or on the other line. The subtext of this message is Im a slave chained to my desk and it is an amazing fact that I have escaped for the moment. One night I was working into the wee hours. At 4 a.m. I decided to leave a message on a colleagues business phone so shed get it as soon as she came in at nine. Hello, the message How to Impress Everyone with Your Outgoing Voicemail Message 251 chirped. This is Felicia. Im either away from my desk or on the other line right now, but leave your message at the tone. Beep. Felicia, of course youre away from your deskits 4 a.m. on Suday morning! On the other line? At this hour? I hope not! You never know how your message is going to affect somone. Just keep yours neutral, friendly, constantly changing, short, and understated. No boasts, no bells, no whistles. Technique #66 Constantly Changing Outgoing Message If you want to be perceived as conscientious and reliable, leave a short, professional, and friendly greeting as your outgoing message. No music. No jokes. No inspirational messages. No boasts, bells, or whistles. And heres the secret: change it every day. Your message doesnt have to be flawless. A little cough or stammer gives a lovely unpretentious reality to your message. How to Get Them to Call You Back Producers of big Broadway musicals can be brutal during audtions. An anxious wanna-be star, after rehearsing his audition song for weeks, steps onstage. He opens his mouth to sing. After a few notes, the heartless producer shouts, Thank you. NEEEXXXT! Dreams of stardom dashed in ten seconds! Businesspeoples professional dreams can also be dashed in the first ten seconds of their audition. Their audition is the message they leave on someone elses answering machine. Competent businesspeople wouldnt dream of sending a messy handwritten business letter to a VIP on cheap yellow-stained paper and expect a response. They know the recipient would toss it in the trash. Nevertheless, some of these same folks will leave a lacluster message on a VIPs voice mail and expect a callback. No one ever told them that big winners scrutinize messages on their voice mail with the same consideration of a big Broadway producer. If you sound good, youve got a chance. If you dont, you are fasforwarded out of their life. Salespeople, suitors, candidates, and competitors who leave crisp, intelligent, upbeat messages on voice mail get called back. Losers with lackluster tones and uncrafted messages never hear from Mr. or Ms. Make It Happen. Make sure your message 252 How to Get Them to Call You Back 253 reflects three Cs: Confidence, Clarity, and Credibility. In addition, make it entice, entertain, or interest the listener. A flat This is Joe, call me back doesnt score with big winners. Stay Tuned For . . . Radio DJs use tricks to keep their listeners tuned in. Top salepeople have similar little tricks to entice prospects to call them back. Heres one called a cliff-hanger. To make sure listeners wont switch stations during the radio commercial, the broadcaster throws out a mini-mystery: And right after the commercial well be back with the winning ticket . . . It could be yours . . . Stay tuned! Whenever you leave a voice mail message for anyone, try to include a cliff-hanger: Hi, Harry, this is Andrew. I have the answer to that question you asked me last week. Or Hi Diane, this is Betsy. I have some big news about that project we were dicussing. Now Harry and Diane have a reason to call Andrew and Betsy back. Pitch personality into your message, too. Picture the people listening to it. Say something to pique their curiosity or make them smile. The message you leave is your ten-second audition. Make it good. Technique #67 Your Ten-Second Audition While dialing, clear your throat. If an answering machine picks up, pretend the beep is a big Broadway producer saying Nexxxt. Now youre on. This is Your Ten-Second Audition to prove you are worthy of a quick callback. Incidentally, if someones voice mail unexpectedly comes on and you are unprepared, quickly hang up (before the beep so they dont get a hang-up message.) Take a moment to craft your entetaining, enticing, or interesting message. Rehearse it once with confidence, clarity, and charisma. Then redial to leave your great hot message. A funny thing happens. If your party answers this time, youll be disappointed. How to Make the Gatekeeper Think Youre Buddy-Buddy with the VIP The inspiration for this next telephone technique comes from pesonal experiences with mid-Manhattan toilets (a less-than-refined origin, to be sure). New York City, in spite of all its reputed sophitication, lags some of the shabbiest European cities in one respect. Manhattan has few public toilets. And none of those Europeastyle, charming, and at times very much appreciated, freestanding structures on street corners. In the days when I made sales calls around the busy city of New York, this presented a problem. Several times a day. I often found myself at the mercy of coffee-shop cashiers who jealously guarded their restroom facilities. Some shops even put menacingly scribbled signs in the window, Bathrooms are for customers only. I often found that if I played it straightgoing up to the cashier and asking if I could use the amenitiesId get shot down. So I used the following technique. Without casting a glance at the cashier, Id strut confidently into the coffee shop. Id march right past the bathroom bouncer and keep my gaze fixed on one of the booths. Shed assume I was coming for lunch or had simply 255 returned to collect my forgotten gloves. Once past the gatekeeper of the loo, Id wait for her to be busy ringing up the next check. Then, like greased lightning, Id sprint into the john. I dubbed this deception The Ho-Hum Caper after my feigned attitude of Ho hum, business as usual. I come here every day with nothing on my mind but lunch. Let us now translate that sneaky subterfuge into a seldofail phone technique. You can use the maneuver to sneak around secretaries and dodge their heartless screening. Instead of plaing it straight and asking for your party by name, just say Is he in? or Is she in? Using the pronoun is verbally sprinting past the secretary with a business as usual, Ho hum, I call every day attitude. Technique #68 The Ho-Hum Caper Instead of using your partys name, casually let the pronoun he or she roll off your tongue. Forget Uh, may I speak to Ms. Bigshot please? Just announce, Hi, Bob Smith here, is she in? Tossing the familiar she off your tongue signals to the secretary that you and her boss are old buddies. How to Make Them Say You Have Super Sensitivity Whenever youre on the phone with someone, you hear a lot more than their voices. In the background you might hear dogs baring, babies crying, or a crackling sound. For all you know, the dog has his tail caught in the refrigerator, the baby has to be fed, or the house is on fire. When you acknowledge the sound by asing if they have to take care of it, you warm the hearts of your listeners. When you are talking to someone at work, you often hear another phone ringing. Say immediately, I hear your other line. Do you have to answer it? Even if not, he or she will appreciate the gesture. If he does have to catch the other call, you can be sure he heard nothing you said after the first ring. Hes only thinking How can I interrupt this babbling person without being rude so I can answer my other phone? In fact with every brr-ing, irrittion sets in that you are holding him hostage from doing what he has to do. Here is the technique guaranteed to save you from being in that uncomfortable position. The subtext, of course, is that you are sensitive to whats going on in your callers world. If youre talking to someone far away or in another country, another way to show youre tops in the com257 munications department is to translate time references into their time zone. When you leave a message, say I can be reached between three and five your time. And dont forget foreign holidays. Last July 1, I was on the phone with a client from Australia. I was impressed when he wished me Happy Independence Day weekend. So impressed, in fact, I ran out to find a chart of international holidays. I made a note in my calendar next January 26 to wish my Aussie friend Happy Australia Day. If you do business with people around the world, be sure to extend good wishes to them for their holidays. Forget about your own if theyre not shared. Im still mortified about the time last November when I was on a conference call with a Canadian client and seven of his salespeople. I wished them all Happy Thanksgiving. Technique #69 I Hear Your Other Line When you hear a phone in the background, stop speakingin midsentence, if necessaryand say I hear your other line, (or your dog barking, your baby crying, your spouse calling you). Ask whether she has to attend to it. Whether she does or not, shell know youre a top communicator for asking. How to Listen Between the Lines on the Phone The first time I saw The Wizard of Oz, the story bewitched me. The second time I saw The Wizard of Oz, the special effects amazed me. The third time I saw The Wizard of Oz, the photoraphy dazzled me. Have you ever seen a movie twice, three times? You notice subtleties and hear sounds you completely missed the first time around. Its the same on the phone. Hearing it is much better the seond time around. Because your business conversations are more consequential than movies, you should listen to them two, maybe three times. Often we have no clear idea of what really happened in our phone conversation until we hear it again. Youll find shaings more significant than the color of Totos collarand more scarecrows than you imagined who havent got a brain! How do you listen to your important business conversations again? Simply legally and ethically tape-record them. I call the technique of recording and analyzing your business conversations for subtleties Instant Replay. Having a tape recorder on her phone could have made a drmatic difference in the career of my friend Laura. Laura, a nutrtionist, had developed an excellent health drink. It deserved to be marketed nationally. 259 I was in Lauras office one day discussing her plans and I said, Laura, Ive got just the contact for you. Several months earlier, I had met Fred, a man who owned a chain of supermarkets. Fred owed me a favor because, at his request, Id given a pro bono talk for a social club he belonged to. Fred was a big banana in the supermarket world, and with one yes he could put my friends health drink in his stores. That would launch Laura nationally. I placed the call and, lo and behold, he was in. And, an even bigger lo and behold, Fred sounded interested in Lauras beverage. Put her on, Fred said. I proudly handed Laura the phone and their conversation started out fine. Oh sure, Ill send you a sample, Laura said. Whats the address? Then I heard Laura say, Uh, wait a minute, let me get something to write with. (I rapidly rolled a pen and pushed a pad in front of her nose.) Uh, whats that again? Did you say 4201 or 4102? [I moan inaudibly.] And how do you spell the name of the street? [My moan becomes audible.] Whoops, this pen just ran out of ink. Leil, do you see another pen on my desk? [I did, and this time I felt like throwing it at her.] Sorry, whats that again? Yikes, now I wanted to grab the phone out of Lauras hands. She shouldnt be bothering a busy big banana for details like repeating addresses. She could have called his secretary back later for clarification. But even that would have been unnecessary if she were recording the conversation with the Instant Replay technique. She could have merely mentioned that she was flipping on the recorder (most heavy hitters are comfortable with that concept) and she would have had it on tape. Fred was nice to Laura that day. But my friend never heard back from him. And to this day, she wonders why. Shell never know the confused phone exchange nixed the deal. Was Fred being unfair just because Laura was a little slow on the phone? Absolutely not. Fred figures, If this woman is as insenHow to Listen Between the Lines on the Phone 261 sitive about my time at the beginning of a possible business reltionship, whats she going to be like down the pike? Wise choice, Fred. I still like Laura. Shes still my friend. But will I introduce her to any other big winners who might help her? I cant take the chance. How to Set Up Your Instant Replay Instant Replay is simple and cheap. Go to your local electronics store and ask for a recorder for your telephone. Slap it on your phone receiver, and plug the other end into a cassette recorder. Then turn the recorder on during your next important converstion. The device could earn you hundreds of dollars on your first call. In some states the law requires you inform the other party you are recording them. Make sure to check with the authorities about the legality in the state where you live. If its one-party cosent, dont worry. Youre the one party. Obviously you must never ever use the tape for any other purpose than for your own second listening. Not only would that be unlawful, but it would be uncoscionable. For extra security, dont leave peoples taped converstions lying around. Keep the same tape in your cassette machine and use it over and over to record important details. With Instant Replay, you can catch balls your conversation partner throws out on the first bounce. Youre on the phone with your boss. He rambles off four or five names in a law firm youre supposed to write to, then the address, then the nine-digit zip code. Realizing hes pitched you some pretty fast balls, he asks, Shall I repeat that for you? No thanks, I got it, you proudly say, silently tapping your little tape recorder. Boss is impressed. Yet another benefit of Instant Replayit helps hide your ignorance. Recently I was on the phone with a cameraman negtiating a price on a videotape to use as a speakers demo. Luckily I was recording the conversation because his flurry of Hi-8, VHS, Super VHS, Beta SP, and three-quarter-inch U-matic had me wanting to crawl into a rodent hole in the wall. But I listened to the tape of our conversation afterward. I wrote down all the words I didnt understand and then asked a video friend what they meant. Now I was able to call the cameraman back and say, Id like a two-camera shoot on Beta SP. And can you give me a VHS dub so I can do some off-line editing? Dont you think I got a much better price than if Id asked, Duh, whats a Beta SP? Forget What They Said, Hear What They Meant Instant Replay also makes you sensitive to levels of communiction far deeper than just your callers words. You tune in to their real enthusiasm or hesitation about an idea. When we want something, our minds play funny tricks on us. If we desperately crave yes from someone, we hear yes. But yes isnt always what it seems. A clients forceful YES and her hesitant yeee-sss are different as heaven and hell. Last month I asked a woman whod booked me for a speech if her office could reproduce my ten-page handout. She gave me the answer I wanted, which was yes. Later, however, I relistened to our conversation Technique #70 Instant Replay Record all your business conversations and listen to them again. The second or third time, you pick up on significant subtleties you missed the first time. Its like football fans who often dont know if there was a fumble until they see it all over again in Instant Replay. How to Listen Between the Lines on the Phone 263 on tape. Her answer about the handouts had been a very hesitant, Hmm, well, yes. I immediately called her back and said, By the way, dont worry about those handouts. Oh, Im so glad! she purred. Because we really dont have the budget for things like that. I gained much more in my clients goodwill than the value of reproducing a few sheets of paper. Let us now return to your live, in-person show. Were going to talk not only about how to be a hit at a party, but how to smoothly hit on all the folks you wantjust like a politician.",

        "text": "PART EIGHT How to Work a Party Like a Politician Works a Room The Politicians Six-Point Party Checklist When invited to a party, most of us waft into a fluffy thought prcess. Our random reverie goes something like this: Hmm, this could be fun. . . . Wonder if theyre going to serve food. . . . Hope its good. . . . Might be some interesting people there. . . . Wo der if my friend so n so is coming. . . . Golly, what should I wear? Thats not the way a politician thinks about a party, however. While politicians, heavy-duty networkers, serious socializers, and big winners in the business world are staring at the invitation, they instinctively surf to a different channel. Before they RSVP with yes or no, their brains craft journalistic campaign questions. Its the Six-Point Party Checklist. Who? When? What? Why? Where? And How? Lets take them one by one. 265 Who Is Going to Be at the Party? More specifically, who will be there that I should meet? Serious networkers calculate Who must I meet for business? Who should I meet for political or social reasons? And, if single and searcing, Who do I want to meet for possible love? If they dont know who is going to be in attendance, they ask. Politicians unabashedly telephone the host or hostess of the party and ask, Whos coming? As the party giver chats casually about the guest list, politicians scribble the names of the people who interest them, then resolve to meet each. When Should I Arrive? Politicians do not leave arrival time to whenever they finish geting dressed. They dont ask themselves, Hmm, should I be fasionably late? They carefully calculate their estimated time of arrival and estimated time of departure. If the party is bulging with contacts, biggies get there early to start hitting their marks as each arrives. VIPs frequently come early to get their business done before party regulars who hate to be the first one there start arriving. They are never embarrassed to arrive early. After all, the only people who see them are other early arrivals who are often heavy hitters like themselves. Nor will you find politicians prowling around, the last to slink out the door. Once theyve accomplished what they set out to do, theyre on their way to the next opportunity. If their agenda is more social, they try to leave their departure time open and their aprŽs-party schedule free. That way, if they make an important new contact, they can stay around and talk with him. Or drive her home. Or go somewhere else for coffee. How to Work a Party Like a Politician Works a Room 267 What Should I Take with Me? A politicians checklist is not the usual, Lets see, my comb, cologne, and breath mints. They pack more functional networing tools in their pockets or purses. If corporate cats will be prowling the party, they pack a pocetful of business cards. If its a gala where people are gadding about on the social ladder and they want to exude old-world elegance, they grab a handful of social cards containing only their name and possibly an address and phone number. (Some feel giving out a business card in a purely social setting can be gauche.) The most vital tool in their party pack is a small pad and pen to keep track of important contacts. Why Is the Party Being Given? The politicians perpetual philosophy of penetrate the ostensible enters here. (Thats just a fancy way of saying look under the rug.) They ask themselves, What is the ostensible reason for the party? A big industrialist is giving his daughter a graduation party? A newly divorced executive is throwing himself a birthday bash? A floundering business is celebrating its tenth year? Nice, politicians say to themselves, thats the ostensible. But whats the real reason for the party? Maybe the industrialist wants to get his daughter a good job so hes invited dozens of potential employers. The birthday boy is single again so the guest list is heavy with attractive and accomplished females. The business deperately needs good PR if its going to stay around another ten years. So theyve invited the press and community makers and shakers. Politicians have expert under-rug vision to spot the hosts real agenda. They will, of course, never discuss it at the party. However, the insight elevates them to a shared state of higher cosciousness with other heavy hitters at the bash. Their knowledge also makes them valuable agents for the party giver. A savvy politician introduces the job-seeking daugter to some executives at the party or tells the most alluring women at the bash what a great guy birthday boy is. When chatting with reporters, he talks up the hosts business that needs good PR. When people support the real why of the party, they become popular and sought-after guests for future events. Where Is the Collective Mind? Often people from one profession or one interest group will coprise most of the guest list. A politician never accepts any invittion without asking herself, What kind of people will be at this party, and what will they be thinking about? Perhaps there will be a drove of doctors. So she clicks on the latest medical headlines and rehearses a little doc-talk. If the guests are a nest of new-age voters, the politician gets up to speed on telepathic healing, Tantric toning, and trance dancing. Politicians cant afford to not be in the know. How Am I Going to Follow Up on the Party? Now, the big finale. I call it Contact Cement. Its cementing the contacts the politician has made. After meeting a good contact and exchanging cards, practically everyone says, Its been great talking to you. Well stay in touch. This good intention seldom happens without herculean effort. Politicians, however, make a science out of keeping up the cotact. After the party, they sit at their desks and, like a game of soltaire, lay out the business cards of the people theyve met. Using How to Work a Party Like a Politician Works a Room 269 The Business Card Dossier technique described later in this setion, they decide how, when, and if to deal with each. Does this person require a phone call? Should that one receive a handwriten note? Shall I E-mail or call the other one? Use the Six-Point Party Checklistthe Who? When? Why? Where? What? and How? of a partyas your general game plan. Now lets get down to specifics. How to Avoid the Most Common Party Blooper The average party goer, lets say Charlie, arrives at the bash. He makes a beeline for the refreshment table for munchies and a beerage. He then finds a few buddies and starts chatting away with them. Chewing the nibbles on his plate and the fat with his friends, he occasionally looks around the room to see who might be new and fun to talk to. Hes hoping several attractive and interesting people at the party will spot him and come over to talk. Whats wrong with Charlies approach? Everything, if Chalie wants to make the party productive. Lets start with the aveage party goers first mistakegetting some refreshments and a drink right off the bat. People mingling at a party make judgments, often subcoscious, about whom they are going to approach. Have you ever lived on a farm? Or had a dog or a cat? Then you know you never disturb animals when they are eating. Likewise, when a human animal is eating, other human animals do not feel comfortable advancing. If party goers eyes scan the crowd and see you with the feed bag on, they pass right over you. Subconsciously theyre saying to themselves, Let the hungry hound chow down and 270 How to Avoid the Most Common Party Blooper 271 maybe well talk later. Later never comes because they wind up making friends with someone else whose mouth wasnt full. Politicians always eat before they come to the party. They know theyd need a circus jugglers talent to shake hands, exchange business cards, hold a drink, and stuff crackers and cheese into their mouthsall with just two hands. Technique #71 Munching or Mingling Politicians want to be eyeball to eyeball and belly to belly with their constituents. Like any big winner well versed in the science of proxemics and spatial relationships, they know any object except their belt buckle has the effect of a brick wall between two people. Therefore they never hold food or drink at a party. Come to munch or come to mingle. But do not expect to do both. Like a good politician, chow down before you come. How to Make an Unforgettable Entrance Loretta Young makes television history when she appears at the head of her immense staircase and surveys the set. Then she swoops down to start the show. The Pope steps out onto his balcony overlooking St. Peters Square in Rome and surveys the crowd. Then he begins the benediction. Bette Davis stops in the doorway and looks around. Then she mutters, What a dump! And every late-night TV comic since Heeeeres Johnny! steps center stage and scrutinizes the applauding audience. Then he reveals the reason for the smirk on his face. What do all these great entrances have in common? Each pauses momentarily and looks around before swooping into decsive action. Movie directors love shots of THE DOORWAY where the camera pans, the music swells, and all eyes gravitate to the hocho or honchoette standing under the frame. Does the star skulk into the room like a frightened little kitten in a new owners home? Or, like many of us do at a party, frantically gravitate to the first familiar face so people wont think he or shes unconnected? No, 272 How to Make an Unforgettable Entrance 273 the star stops. Then, framed by the doorway, his or her notable presence is felt by all. People who have mastered this trick have what envious thatrical wanna-bes call stage presence. Stage groupies think some lucky stars are born with it. Think again, thespians. Its cultivated. Politicians dont just slink unnoticed into a roomful of people. Politicians make The Entrance. With one simple technique, you too can make great entrances. I call it Rubberneck the Room. Before entering, stop dramatically in the doorway and survey the scene s-l-o-w-l-y with your eyes. It is significant that, while youre standing in the doorway, youre not thinking, Look at me. The reason youre Rubbernecking the Room is not to show off. It is so you can diagnose the situation youre walking into. Take note of the lighting, the bar, and most important, the faces. Listen to the music, the buzz of the crowd, the clinking of glasses. See who is talking to whom. While rubbenecking, youll also be using Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee, the next technique, which helps you select your first, second, and maybe third target. Now, like the big cat who rules the jungle, leap in to make your first move toward wiping up the room. In tandem with Rubberneck the Room, try using the folloing technique. Technique #72 Rubberneck the Room When you arrive at the gathering, stop dramatically in the doorway. Then s-l-o-w-l-y survey the situation. Let your eyes travel back and forth like a SWAT team ready in a heartbeat to wipe out anything that moves. How to Meet the People YOU Want to Meet Politicians dont wait for others to approach them. If the party host or their campaign manager has not supplied a must meet list, they choose their targets while Rubbernecking the Room. As their keen eyes scan the crowd, theyre asking themselves Who would I most enjoy talking to? Who looks like they could be most beeficial to my life? Who could I learn most from in this gang? How do they choose? They look at everyone the same way my friend, Bob, the caricature artist, looks at people. You can tell a whole lot more than you realize if you keep your gaze fixed on someone. Every twinkle in someones eye and every line surounding it tells a storythe story of the life he or she leads. Who was it who said, At age thirty, everyone has the face he deserves? Yet few of us consciously look into strangers eyes. How foolish that, at a party or convention for making contacts, most people are embarrassed to make eye contact with people we dont know. In my networking seminar, I prime participants to make intense visual contact by asking them to form a big circle, walk around the room, and silently stare at each other. Gaze into each others eyes, I tell them. Examine each others movements. As they are walking, I say, The most important business cotact, the dearest friend, or the love of your life is probably not in 274 How to Meet the People YOU Want to Meet 275 this room. Nevertheless, sometime soon, you will be in a room where you will spot someone you sense could change your life. I want you to be prepared. I want you to have the courage to make the approach and not wait in vain for that special someone to approach you. While strolling and staring, I ask them to silently choose the four people they most want to talk to during the break. Only the Beautiful People Will Be Chosen When given this unfamiliar and uncomfortable assignment, the participants assume everyone will make a beeline for the most attractive people. It never happens. Something mystical occurs when people take the time to really look at each other. Everyone discovers a distinctive beauty in one or two other people that is very personal, very special, and speaks uniquely to the seeker. The dearest friend in my life was a homely little fellow named Chip. He was only 5 feet 2 inches tall. Chip had a huge nose and funny little eyes peeping out through thick glasses. At a party, without using this technique, I probably would never have noticed Chip. However, my concentration was on him the day we met because he was giving a speech. When I gazed intently into his eyes and watched his lips moving, I saw such subjective beauty coming from his face. He became my best friend for twelve years until a tragic disease took his life. Nevertheless, Chip remained beautiful to me until the end because, no matter how twisted his body became with illness, the beauty shone through his spirit. As the seminar participants explore each others faces and movements, they discover the subjective beauty in their faces, in their spirits. No one can explain why one person chooses another as one of his or her special four. Yet practically everyone returns from the break having made a new good friend. Never is anyone left unchosen. When you seek peoples special qualities by exploring their faces, you will find them. If you want to walk out of any gatheing with your life enhanced, spend time with people you choose, not just those who choose you. Be choosey in who you pick. But dont wait to be the choosee. Sure, in a Seminar, Its Easy, but What About Real Life? Sometimes, after the break, a participant will say, It was simple to go up to people I wanted to talk to this time because you gave it as an assignment. But what about at a real party? Recently, one of my participants named Todd asked me this question in front of the group. I asked, Todd, how did you make the approach this time? Well, I just went up and said, Hi, Im Todd. I wanted to talk to you. Well? I asked. Technique #73 Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee The lifelong friend, the love of your life, or the business contact who will transform your future may not be at the party. However, someday, somewhere, he or she will be. Make every party a rehearsal for the big event. Do not stand around waiting for the moment when that special person approaches you. You make it happen by exploring every face in the room. No more ships passing in the night. Capture whatever or whomever you want in your life. How to Meet the People YOU Want to Meet 277 It dawned on him that he could use this opening phrase to meet anyone at any party. To smooth a potentially awkward moment, you quickly follow up with an innocuous question like How do you know the hostess? or Do you live in the area? Now, youre off and running just as though the host had intrduced you. Of course, other choosey people will be prowling around the party. Some of them, after scrutinizing you, will decide you are one of the special people they choose to talk to. The following is a subliminal maneuver to make it easy for them come over to cofirm they made a wise choice. How to Subliminally Lure People to You at a Gathering Have you ever noticed how comfortable you feel sauntering into certain rooms? The chairs are arranged in a way that welcomes you as if saying, Come right on in and sit on me. Conversely, you enter other rooms where you must navigate a circuitous route around tables and dressers before you finally find a free chair. Likewise, some people arrange their body furniture, their arms and legs, to say, Hey, come right on over and talk to me. Yet other peoples body furniture shouts, Keep out! Approach at your own risk. Shy people inadvertently say stay away when they fold their arms. They give off insecure signals by clutching a purse, clasping a drink, or smoking a cigarette. Controlled studies show that party goers are more comforable approaching people who stand with an open body, arms uncrossed and hanging at their sides, legs slightly separated, a slight smile on their faces. Any object between you and the crowd is a subliminal cutoffeven your purse. More people approach a woman who sports a shoulder bag than one squeezing a handbag. The shoulder bag hangs behind her back, thus leaving the path to talk to her open. 278 How to Subliminally Lure People to You at a Gathering 279 Give Them the Ol Wrist Flash Now, heres the pi�ce de rŽsistance. Next to your face, your wrists and palms are one of the most expressive parts of your body. Palms up speak volumes of good sentiments. The Popes wrists and palms are up when he beckons Come unto me my brethren. The burglars wrists and palms are up when he says, I give up, dont shoot. The innocent mans wrists and palms are up when hes saying, I dont know who took the money. Vulnerable, open palms signify I have nothing to hide. They also signify acceptance. When you are listening to a business colleague to whom you want to signal acceptance, make sure your wrists and palms are up. Even if youre resting your head on your chin, turn your wrists forward. Whenever you are chating with anyone, give yourself a constant hand check. Make sure you dont point your knuckles directly toward anyone. Let them have the pleasure of seeing the soft, tender come hither skin of your wrists and palms, not the wrinkled go away hide on your knuckles. Romance on your mind? Ladies, let your hands do some taling for you. Women instinctively turn their wrists and palms upward when a man excites them. (In fact, the ol wrist flash while talking with males subconsciously gives them a sexy jolt.) Pave a Clear Path for People Who Find You Special Frightened little jungle cats crouch behind rocks and logs so no bigger animals will spot them. In the social jungle, shy people do the same. They instinctively seek out corners and sit in seats where they wont be seen. Technique #74 Come-Hither Hands Be a human magnet, not a human repellent. When standing at a gathering, arrange your body in an open positionespecially your arms and hands. People instinctively gravitate toward open palms and wrists seductively arranged in the come hither position. They shy away from knuckles in the get lost or Ill punch you position. Use your wrists and palms to say I have nothing to hide, I accept you and what youre saying, or I find you sexy. Whereas lynxes and lions stroll confidently to the center of the jungle clearing, human big cats in the social jungle also stand confidently in a clearing so others can see them. Like a politician, position yourself near a doorway since everyone must pass your way at some point in the evening. Now we come to a technique all politicians use. In fact, some political pundits have credited the election of both John Kennedy and Bill Clinton to their mastery of the technique I call Tracking. How to Make Em Feel Like a Movie Star In the 1940s, movies were different. Before experimental films, ciema veritŽ, and nouvelle vague, they had stories. Americans hopped in their Buicksa foxtail tied to the radio antenna and baby boots suspended from the rearview mirrordrove to the movie house, and watched a story unfold before them. Almost invariably, the hero and heroine on the silver screen would meet, fall in love, overcome seemingly impossible obstacles, get married, and (presumably) live happily after. Oh, the stories varied slightly. But there was always a leading man and maybe a leading woman. Then there was the rest of the world. The suporting characters could live or die without much brouhaha. But every minor event in the stars life was significant. Well, movies may have changed. Human nature hasnt. Everone feels like the star of a 1940s movie. Every trivial event in their lives is momentous. Theres ME. Then theres the rest of the world. What someone had for breakfast, what shoes he chose to wear, and whether he took time to floss his teeth can be more impotant to that particular someone than the fall of faraway nations or the rise of global temperatures. Husbands and wives sometimes share their spouses minutiae: 281 What did you have for breakfast, Honey? You didnt wear those shoes, did you? Did you remember to floss? To create an interesting intimacy, big winners make a point to remember minute details of important contacts lives. They obvously dont feign interest in what they had for breakfast or whether they flossed or forgot. But to make someone feel like a big star, they remember details their contact does happen to share. Take their lead. If a prospect mentions he had Rice Krispies for breakfast, allude to it later. If, in chatting, your boss tells you she wore uncomfortable shoes to work one day, find a way to refer to it on another. If your client mentions hes a resolute flosser, co pliment him at a later date on his discipline. It hints he or she is a memorable star in the galaxy of people youve met. Its called Tracking their lives. When you track their minutiae, you make them feel like 1940s movie stars and that minor events in their lives are major concerns in yours. Dont Leave It to Chance Politicians make a science out of Tracking. They keep a little black box either on their desk, in their computer, or in their brain of the last concern, enthusiasm, or event discussed with everyone in their life. They keep track of where the people were, what they said, and what they were doing since the last conversation. Then the first words of the next phone call or meeting with that person relates to that information: Hello, Joe. How was your trip to Jamaica? Hey Sam, did your kid make the baseball team? Hi, Sally. Have you heard back from your client yet? Nice to hear from you, Bob. It means you survived that Szechuan restaurant you were going to last time we spoke. How to Make Em Feel Like a Movie Star 283 When you invoke the last major or minor event in anyones life, it confirms what theyve known all along. Theyre the most important person in the world. One of the most powerful forms of tracking is remembering anniversaries of peoples personal achievements. Did your boss get promoted to her present position one year ago today? Did your client go public? How much more memorable than a birthday card to send a one-year congratulations note. Remembering peoples private passions is another. Several years ago, I wrote regularly for a magazine. My then-editor, Carie, was obsessed with her new kitten named Cookie. Recently I ran into Carrie at a writers conference. In early conversation I said to her, I guess Cookies a full-grown cat by now. How is she? Carries astonished smile was my reward. Leil, she squealed, I cant believe you remember Cookie. Yes, shes fine now and . . . Carrie went on for another ten miutes about Cookie, the now full-grown cat. Technique #75 Tracking Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your conversation partners lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a poweful sense of intimacy. When you invoke the last major or minor event in anyones life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom. A week later I got a call from Carrie asking me if Id do a big story for her magazine. Did she think of me because I used the Tracking technique and remembered Cookie? Nobody can say, but I have my suspicions. Ive seen the Tracking technique work on too many people to assume the rewards are coincidental. How do politicians remember so many facts to track about so many people? They use the following technique. How to Amaze Them with What You Remember About Them Several years ago, I attended a political fund-raising event in a Midwestern state. One guest intrigued me. Sometimes Id see him in animated conversation with several people. Other times, hed be standing alone scribbling something on a card in his hand. Then the next time Id look up, hed be chatting it up with somone else. The next minute, hed be scribbling in his hand again. He repeated this pattern for over an hour. I became as curious as a nosy neighbor. Who was this fellow? At one point during the evening, I was standing alone by the refreshment table. He came up to me with a big smile, a warm handshake, and introduced himself. Hi, Im Joe Smith. He asked me what I was drinking. I told him white wine and we started dicussing preferences. I happened to mention my favorite white was Sancerre. While we talked, I had to bite my tongue to resist asing him what hed been up to with the feverish note taking. A few minutes later, I spotted a friend across the room and excused myself. He asked for my card and, as I walked away, I peeked over my shoulder. I knew it! There he was, scribbling on my card. That was my opening. I turned back and, trying to pass my inquiry off as a joke, said, Hey, I didnt give you my meaurements. Whats that youre writing? 285 He gave a hearty laugh at my tasteless joke and said, You caught me! He turned over my card and I saw one word written on it: Sancerre. Then, to assuage my paranoia, he emptied his pocketful of peoples business cards to show me scribbles on the back of each. I assumed it was just Joes little system to help him remember people. It wasnt until months later that I saw the method to his madness. One morning I went to my mailbox and found a personal postcard from Joe. He told me he was running for state senator. Then at the bottom of the card, hed written, Had any good Sancerre lately? That won my heart. Had I lived in his state, a litle touch like that might have swayed my vote to him. They may not jump up and down asking, How did you remember that? Nevertheless, they will remember you. No matter how important the VIP, he or she senses a special kinship Technique #76 The Business Card Dossier Right after youve talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation: his favorite restaurant, sport, movie, or drink; whom she admires, where she grew up, a high school honor; or maybe a joke he told. In your next communication, toss off a reference to the favorite restaurant, sport, movie, drink, hometown, high school honor. Or reprieve the laugh over the great joke. How to Amaze Them with What You Remember About Them 287 with the person who refers to other than their usual well-known accomplishments. Politicians are constantly selling themselves. (If youve ever wondered why America is called The Land of Promise, just keep your ears open in election year.) But, of course, to know what to promise people, politicians use the next super sales technique called Eyeball Selling. How to Make the Sale with Your Eyeballs The percentage of sales that Jimmi, a good friend of mine, makes is not to be believed. Even his sales manager doesnt know how he does it. But I do. Because he told me. Jimmi says the fancy sales techniques hes learned over the years (Benefits Selling, Partnering, Selling to Personality Types, Value-Added Concept, Rejection Proofing, Spin Selling) all pale next to what he calls Eyeball Selling. Eyeball Selling is not memorizing two dozen closing tecniques. Nor is it verbally sparring with a customer to overcome objections. Jimmi says its quite simply keeping his eyes open, watching his customers reactions, and adjusting his sales pitch according to how his customers body moves. While Jimmi is giving his sales pitch, hes concentrating more on how his customer fidgets, twitches, and squirms than on what hes saying. Hes scrutinizing his customers involuntary head movments. Hes studying her hand gestures, her body rotation, her facial expressionseven her eye fluctuations. Jimmi says when his cutomer is not saying a word, even if shes trying to give you a poker face, she cannot not communicate. She may not say in words how receptive she is to your pitch, but shes clearly telling you nonethless. Jimmi says knowing what turns a prospect on, what turns her off, and what leaves her neutral from moment to moment can make or break the sale. 288 How to Make the Sale with Your Eyeballs 289 How Jimmi Finds Out Where the Buck Stops The product Jimmi sells is expensive lighting equipment. Often he must make sales presentations to groups of ten, twenty, or more people. He says, The first challenge in Eyeball Selling is discoering who the real decision maker is. Jimmi meets his challenge in an unorthodox (not necessarily recommended) way. Right after Good afternoon, gentlemen and ladies, he says something slightly confusing. Why? Because the surprised group doesnt know how to react. So their heads all twirl like weather vanes on a windy day to look atguess who?the honcho, the heavyweight, the head man or woman. Now Jimmis got his decision maker so he can continue Eyeball Selling to that person. What to Do When You Get Your Cue Some signals are obvious, Jimmi says. People shrug their shouders for indifference, tap their fingers for impatience, or loosen their collar when they feel uncomfortable. But there are hundreds of other unconscious gestures I keep my antennae tuned for. For example, I watch the exact angle of my prospects head position. If its fully facing me, especially if its cocked at a cute little angle, it means theyre interested. In that case, I keep right on talking. But if their head is slightly turning away, thats a bad sign. I take it as a cue to change the subject and maybe talk about a different benefit of my product. Jimmi not only tailors what hes saying to his customers reations, but he actively takes steps to change his prospects body postion if he feels its not receptive. He says, The body must be open before the mind can follow. For example, he continues, If your customer has his arms crossed in front of his chest, hand him somthing to look at so he has to unfold them to take it from you. Jimmi always carries a briefcase full of props to break down the barriers. He has photos of his wife and kids to hand married prospects, snashots of his Skye terrier for customers that have a dog, an antique watch to show antique lovers, and a pocket-size computer to show gadget fanatics. Jimmi says, As long as I can get them to open their arms to reach for something, I have a shot at their minds. Jimmi also paces the timing of his pitch to match his cutomers covert reactions. When his client reaches for an object, he takes it as a cue to talk slower or just be quiet. Reaching for a paper clip or fondling a folder on the desk says, Im thinking about it. Of course, Jimmi is on constant lookout for sales-ready sinals like picking up the contract, fondling the pen, or turning their palms up. At that point, he cuts quickly to the close. Another cue to bring out the contract-signing pen is when your prospects head starts bobbing up and down like a plastic duck. Theyre silently screaming, Yes, Ill buy! Unskilled salepeople just keep on talking until they finish the pitch they learned in training. Many keep talking so long, they unsell themselves. Conversely, when customers move their heads back and forth, no matter what they are saying, they mean No! Eyeballing Is Not for Selling Only Without a word, your friends and loved ones also show their wishes. When my friend Deborah became engaged to Tony, it seemed obvious to everyoneexcept Deborahthat it was not a marriage made in heaven. A few months before their wedding I said, Deb, are you really sure Tonys the one for you? Oh yes, she said, her head moving right and left, back and forth, I love him very much. That marriage never took place. Her body recognized what her mind hadnt yet realized. Like a politician, think of your social conversations as sales pitches. Even if you have no product, you want them to buy your ideas. If your listener turns away while youre talking, dont conHow to Make the Sale with Your Eyeballs 291 centrate on how rude the person is. Like a sales pro, ask yourself, How can I change the subject to turn this person on? If their whole body starts to turn away, use the time-honored personal question ploy. Ask about their favorite topic. George, how big did you say that bass you caught last week was? Or use his name and ask a personal question. Thats always a grabber. Archibald, what did you say the name of your high school football team was? Weve talked about only a few responses. Hints for reading someones body language could fill a book. In fact, they have many of them. I suggest a few of my favorites in the references. 2126 Read up on body language and tune in to its visual channel wheever youre trying to sell to people, get their vote, or convince them youre the best candidate for the job or the role of life partner. Wouldnt it be super to have Jimmis success rate with our listeners accepting whatever we say? We can if we just keep our eyes open. A Quick Review Thats all there is to it. Youll remember to eat before coming to the party (the Munching or Mingling technique) to leave your Technique #77 Eyeball Selling The human body is a twenty-four-hour broadcasting station that transmits You thrill me. You bore me. I love that aspect of your product. That one puts my feet to sleep. Set the hidden cameras behind your eyeballs to pick up on all your customers and friends signals. Then plan your pitch and your pace accordingly. hands free for heavy networking. When you arrive, youll stop in the doorway and Rubberneck the Room to get the lay of the land. While rubbernecking, youll Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee and pick your prospects for the evening. When standing around, you will be relaxing and inviting with Come-Hither Hands. You havent forgotten, of course, to use the meeting-people techniques from previous chapters. If you spot someone you want to talk to, check them out for a Whatzit you can comment on. Finding none, just ask the party giver, Whoozat? If the host or hostess is not in sight, simply stand near your target and resort to the Eavesdrop In technique. While chatting with anyone youve previously met, you will, of course, use Tracking to win their vote or heart and all the tecniques in Part Two to ensure the conversation is interesting for your new acquaintance. Finally, youll employ Eyeball Selling to make sure youre on target with every conversation. And dont foget, as you say so long, to scribble material for your next contact on your Business Card Dossier. Its a good feeling when youve done it all right. Continue using these techniques politicians use to work a room, and youll suffer no more unimportant parties. And, following the advice throughout the book, youll never strike anyone as an unimpotant person. Now we move on to the advanced section of How to Talk to Anyone. Some of the following techniques may make you scratch your head in confusion. Pay special attention to the ones that do because it means somewhere, sometime, you might find yourself scratching your head over something much more painfullike the bump from hitting a glass ceiling, or why the business deal, frienship, or love affair went sour.

        "text": "PART NINE How to Break the Most Treacherous Glass Ceiling of All Sometimes People Are Tigers Every week, when I was a kid, my mother took me to the National Geographic Society to see a film. The one on tigers invades my nightmares these many years later. Sitting there in the darkened theater, I watched a mother give birth to three tiny cubs. One was born with a mangled leg. I witnessed how all the other tiger cubs excluded him. And right there in front of the cameras, he was totured to death by the others. I remember crying and thinking how the healthy cubs were like a few of the kids in my school. Somtimes they could be very cruel. My best friend in grade school was Stella and she was a beatiful girl inside and out. But she had a speech defect, a cleft palate. And many of our classmates laughed at her behind her back and excluded her from their games. Kids havent changed much. When I give talks for colleges and young peoples groups, the discussion often turns to popularity. Everyone wants to be liked. Occasionally students tell me stories 293 about how some girl has a minor physical defect, say, a crossed eye or a nervous twitch. They say some kids laugh and make fun of her. Or a boy has a limp so no one chooses him for their baseball team. Even if he can run just as fast as the other kids, some of his classmates dont like the image of a cripple being on their side. The years go by and kids become adults. Not too much changes. Adults are not as cruel, happily, about physical disabilties. But they can be brutal about social disabilities. Social diabilities are insidious because often we dont recognize them in ourselves. We can be blind to our social handicaps and deaf to our verbal deficiencies. But were quick to recognize them in others. How many times has one of your associates made a dumb, insensitive gaffe? How often have you written somebody off because of some stupid move? Do you think he knew what he was doing? Of course not. He had no idea he was crossing a line or stepping on your toes. Probably no one ever told him about the subtleties were going to discuss in this final section of How to Talk to Anyone. Weve all heard about the glass ceiling some companies costruct over women and minorities. People seldom discuss another kind of glass ceiling. This one is even more treacherous because you cant legislate against it and only top communicators reconize it. Yet its a rock-hard shield. Many bright individuals hit their heads on the thick glass as they try to climb up the next rung of the ladder to join the big boys and big girls on top. The folks able to crash through are the ones who abide by the unspoken rules that follow. Consider each of the following techniques. If you find any of them obvious, give yourself a pat on the back. It means youre already a tiger on that one. Be on the lookout for those commnications sensitivities where you find yourself saying, You gotta be kidding! Whats wrong with that? Watch out! It means someday, somewhere, you might commit that particular insensitivity. Then, when a big winner responds How to Break the Most Treacherous Glass Ceiling of All 295 coolly to your suggestion, doesnt return your phone call, doesnt give you the promotion, doesnt invite you to the party, doesnt accept your date, youll never know what happened. Read each of the following techniques to ensure youre not making any of these subtle mistakes, that let the big players lacerate you and keep you from getting what you want in life. How to Win Their Affection by Overlooking Their Bloopers One remarkable reaction opened my eyes to yet another diffeence between big winners and little losers. Several years ago I was doing a project for a client. I had the pleasure of being taken to lunch by the four biggest fish in the firm. They wanted to famiiarize me with communications problems their company was experiencing. We went to a busy midtown restaurant at peak lunchtime. Every table was filled with a variety of corporate creatures. Uppeand middle-management types were lunching in their suits and ties or high-collar blouses. Workers and secretaries were muncing in their blue shirts or short skirts. The restaurant was buzzing with conversation and conviviality. Over the entrŽe, we were in deep discussion about the copanys challenges. The CFO, Mr. Wilson, was talking about the financial outlook when suddenly, BLAM! Not six feet away, a waiter dropped a tray full of dishes. Glasses broke, silverware clatered against the marble floor, and a hot baked potato rolled under our table in a direct path for Wilsons feet. 296 How to Win Their Af fection by Overlooking Their Bloopers 297 Practically everyone in the restaurant turned toward the humiliated waiter. We heard a cacophony of Uh-oh, Buterfingers! Whoops, watch it! Boy, thats his last lunch here, and a variety of tittering and derisive laughter. Wilson, however, didnt miss a word of his monologue. Not one big player at my table turned or blinked an eye. It was as though nothing had happened. The restaurant gradually quieted down around us as we continued our deliberations. (A few miutes later the baked potato shot back out from under our table. At that moment, I found myself wondering whether Wilson had been a soccer player in his youth.) Over coffee, the director of marketing, Ms. Dawson, was dicussing the companys planned expansion. Suddenly she made an expansive gesture with her arms that knocked over her coffee cup. Just as I was about to say, Oh dear, I bit my tongue. Before I could grab my napkin to help, Dawson was dabbing the muddy puddle with hers, and not missing a syllable of her soliloquy. None of her cool colleagues at the table even seemed to notice the ove turned cup. At that instant, I realized big boys and big girls see no blooers, hear no bloopers. They never say Butterfingers or Whoops or even Uh-oh. They ignore their colleagues boners. They siply dont notice their comrades minor spills, slips, fumbles, and blunders. Thus, the technique See No Bloopers, Hear No Blooers was born. Let Me Suffer in Your Silence I have one friend who every time I sneeze says, Oh, are you coing down with a cold? Every time I miss a step on a curb, its Be careful! Every time he sees me after a long days work he asks, Are you tired? Granted, this is small fry in the great bouillabaisse of bloopers. And the poor guy probably genuinely thinks hes being sensitive to my needs. But, darn it, coming down with a cold, missing the curb, and looking tired are less than cool. Let me sufferin YOUR silence. If youre having dinner with a friend and she makes a boner, be blind to her overturned glass. Be deaf to her sneeze, cough, or hiccups. No matter how well-meaning your gesundheit, whoops, or knowing smile, nobody likes to be reminded of their own human frailty. Fine, you say, for small slips, but what should one do in extreme circumstances? Say a rippling tide of soda is flooding across the table in your direction and it will be impossible to ignore by the time it reaches your lap. If possible, deftly flip your napkin to obstruct the current and keep talking. Try not to miss a syllable of the sentence you started before the oncoming tide. At this point, your companion might mutter incoherent apologies. Adroitly weave a parenthetical Its nothing into your current phrase and continue talking. On such small sands the castles of big cat camaraderie are built. Technique #78 See No Bloopers, Hear No Bloopers Cool communicators allow their friends, associates, acquaintances, and loved ones the pleasurable myth of being above commonplace bloopers and embarrassing biological functions. They simply dont notice their comrades minor spills, slips, fumbles, and faux pas. They obviously ignore raspberries and all other signs of human frailty in their fellow mortals. Big winners never gape at anothers gaffes. How to Win Their Af fection by Overlooking Their Bloopers 299 If people hate to be reminded of the moments when theyre not shining, there is another event almost as disillusioning. It is when a talker is shining and the spotlight abruptly pivots to a more urgent matter. The speaker is forgotten in the flurry. Top communicators put the glow back in the gloomy gabbers eyes with the technique that follows. How to Win Their Heart When Their Tongue Is Faltering In ancient Japan, if you saved someones life, it was their selimposed task to spend the rest of their life serving you. Nowadays, if you rescue someones story, a molecule of that ancient instinct still gushes through his or her veins. It happens all the time. Someone in a group is telling a story and, just before their big point, BOOM! Theres an interruption. Someone new joins the group, a catering person with a tray of crackers and cheese comes over, or a baby starts crying. Suddenly everyones attention turns to the new arrival, the nibbles on the tray, or the adorable little tyke. Nobody is aware of the interuptionexcept the speaker. They forget all about the fact that the speaker hasnt made his or her point. Or youre all sitting around the living room and someone is telling a joke. Suddenly, just before their big punch line, little Johnny drops a dish or the phone rings. After the crash, everyone talks about little Johnnys clumsiness. After the call, the subject turns to the impending marriage or medical operation of the caller. Nobody remembers the great punch line got abortedexcept the joke teller. (When its you regaling everyone at a restaurant, have 300 How to Win Their Heart When Their Tongue Is Faltering 301 you ever noticed how you can almost set your clock by the waiter coming to take everyones order just before your hilarious punch line?) Most joke and story tellers are too timid to say, after the invsion, Now, as I was saying . . . Instead, theyll spend the rest of the evening feeling miserable they didnt get to finish. Heres where you come in. Rescue them with the technique I call Lend a Hel ing Tongue. Watch the gratitude in the storytellers eyes as he stabilizes where his story sunk and he sails off again toward the center of attention. His expression and the recognition of your sensitivity by the rest of the group are often reward enough. You are even more fortunate if you can rescue the story of someone who can hire you, promote you, buy from you, or otherwise lift your life. Big winners have elephantine memories. When you do them subtle favors like Lend a Helping Tongue, they find a way to pay you back. Technique #79 Lend a Helping Tongue Whenever someones story is aborted, let the interrution play itself out. Give everyone time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story-interruptus, Now please get back to your story. Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, So what happened after the . . . (and fill in the last few words). Harvey Mackay, the worlds most notable networker who rose from envelope salesman to corporate CEO and one of Americas most sought-after business and motivational speakers, teaches us that the world goes round on favors. How right he is! The next three techniques reveal unspoken subtleties of this critical balance of power. How to Let Em Know Whats In It for Them Savvy businesspeople know everyone is constantly tuned to the same radio stationWIIFM. Whenever anyone says anything, the listeners instinctive reaction is whats in it for me? Sales pros have elevated this constant query to the exalted status of acronym, WIIFM. They pay such strict attention to the WIIFM principle that they dont open their pitch with the features of their product or service. Top pros start by highlighting the benefits to the buyer. Except for tactical reasons during sensitive negotiating, big winners lay both whats in it for me? and whats in it for you? (WIIFY) right out on the table. This is so critical that, if one caouflages WIIFM or WIIFY, the concealer is relegated to the sttus of little loser. I once invited a casual acquaintance to lunch. I had hoped to consult with Sam, the head of a marketing association, on my speaking business. I told him my desire and jokingly asked if an hour of his valuable time was available in return for lunch at a great restaurant. That was my way of saying, Look Sam, I know theres no real benefit to you except a tasty lunch and the dubious plesure of my company. (In other words, I was revealing WIIFY.) To make the meeting even more convenient for him, I said, Sam, choose the date and the best restaurant in your neighborhood. 303 The day of our lunch consultation rolled around and I traeled forty-five minutes across town to his chosen restaurant. As I entered, I was surprised to see an assortment of people arranged around the largest table in the room with Sam as the smiling ce terpiece. Obviously, this was not the setting in which I could cosult with him. Unfortunately, Sam had already spotted me by the coat check. I was trapped. It wasnt until after-lunch coffee arrived that I realized why Sam had assembled the group. He wanted each to donate presetations on their particular expertise to his organization. The sly fox hadnt revealed his own whats in it for me? Had Sam been a straight shooter and big player, he would have told me on the phone, Leil, Im getting a group of speakers who might be helpful to my organization together for a Dutctreat lunch. I will, of course, try to answer your questions about your speaking business, but we will be a group of ten. Would you like to join us, or shall we choose another date when we can have more privacy? I would gladly have spoken pro bono for Sams group had he been up-front about it. Instead, by not revealing WIIFM, we both lost. I lost a half day and, because of his trickiness, he lost my free speech for his group. Dont Deny Them the Pleasure of Helping You Big winners also lay their cards on the table when asking someone for a favor. Many well-meaning folks are embarrassed to say how important the favor is to them. So they ask as though its a casual inquiry when its not. A friend of mine named Stefan once asked me if I knew any bands his organization could hire for their annual event. I told him No, Im sorry. I really dont. But Stefan didnt let it go at that. He pressed, Leil, didnt you once work with bands on ships? How to Let Em Know Whats In It for Them 305 I told him Yes, but I no longer have contact with them. I thought that was the end of it. But Stefan didnt. He grilled me further and I found myself getting confused and irritated. Finally I said, Stefan, whos in charge of getting the band? He sheepishly said, I am. Criminy jicketts, Stefan, why didnt you tell me it was your responsibility? In that case, let me do some research and see if I can find a good one for you. I was happy to do my friend a favor. But Stefan, by not telling me how important it was to him, risked not getting help. He also went down a notch or two in his friends esteem by not revealing WIIFM. When asking someone for a favor, let them know how much it means to you. You come across as a straight shooter, and the joy of helping you out is often reward enough. Dont deny them that pleasure! Asking or granting favors is a fabric that holds together only when woven with utmost sensitivity. Let us explore more ways to stitch this delicate cloth so your relationship doesnt rip. Technique #80 Bare the Buried WIIFM (and WIIFY) Whenever you suggest a meeting or ask a favor, divulge the respective benefits. Reveal whats in it for you and whats in it for the other personeven if its zip. If any hidden agenda comes up later, you get labeled a sly fox. How to Make Them Want to Do Favors forYou One of my clients, Susan Evans, heads up a large real estate firm. Once, sitting in her office discussing an upcoming project, her seretary buzzed. Excuse me, Ms. Evans, its your brother-in-law Harry on the phone. Oh, of course, she smiled, put him on. My client, maing apologies for the interruption, picked up the phone. I left the room for a few moments to give her privacy. When I returned, Susan was just hanging up, saying, Sure, have him phone me. She told me the call was from her brothein-law whose young cousin worked in a gas station but was inteested in a career in real estate. The young man is going to call me and Ill see if I can help him out. It was obvious she was happy to do her brother-in-law a favor. We picked up our discussion where we left off. Not four minutes later, the secretary buzzed again. Ms. Evans, a Sonny Laker is on the line. He says hes your brother-ilaw Harrys cousin and hes supposed to call you. My client was taken aback. I could tell from her expression she was saying to heself, Boy, my overanxious brother-in-law didnt waste any time, did he? It seemed obvious to both of us what had happened. Like 306 How to Make Them Want to Do Favors for You 307 greased lightning, Harry must have hot-breathedly called Cousin Sonny to give him the big headline: Evans Would See Him! Then, by dialing Ms. Evans immediately, Sonny made it seem the bideal interview was the most important event in his otherwise dull and dismal life. True or not, one verity remainedLittle Cousin was insenstive to an unspoken rule big winners always obey: dont jump immediately when someone is doing you a favor. Allow the peson granting the favor time to savor the pleasure of agreeing to it, before having to pay up. Both brother-in-law and potential employee slipped in Evanss estimate, all because of timing. To ensure the kid wouldnt call his real-estate-mogul sister-in-law too quickly, Harry should have waited a day before telling his cousin the good news. Also, young Sonny should have asked Cousin Harry about Evanss schedule. Sometimes an immediate call is advantageous but not when somone is granting you a favor. One might think Evans was unfair judging Sonny harshly just because he didnt let her savor the favor. It runs deeper than that. Evanss subconscious thought process goes something like this: If this kid is insensitive to the subtleties of timing when getting a Technique #81 Let Em Savor the Favor Whenever a friend agrees to a favor, allow your generous buddy time to relish the joy of his or her beneficence before you make them pay the piper. How long? At least twenty-four hours. job, how sensitive is he going to be when negotiating the sale of a house? One agents overanxious call to an owner can mean thosands lost in commissions for the firm. Big winners have supernatural vision into your future. They see every communications blunder you make as a visible blotch on your x-ray. It dims your prognosis for being successful in life. Lets look at yet another tenuous thread between favor asker and favor grantor that must not be severed lest the relationship unravel. How to Ask for Favors (and Get Them!) I once asked a well-connected friend who works in a top Los Angeles talent agency if she knew any celebrities I could contact for a project I was working on. Tania flipped though her Rolodex and came up with just the names I needed. It was obvious to both of us, I owed her big time. When I thanked her profusely on the phone, Tania said, Oh Im sure youll find a way to pay me back. Well, of course I will, I said. That goes without saying. And well it should have gone without saying. She was reminding me the favor wasnt out of friendship, but because she expected something in return. Two days later, Tania called and said she was coming to New York in a few months. She was just checking now if I could put her up then. Naturally I could, but blatantly cashing in on the return favor so quickly was not a smooth move. When someone does something nice for you, you find yourself with an elephants memory. In fact, you consciously look for ways to return the favor. Had Tania called, even years later, of course I would have remebered I owed her one. Frankly, I was glad it came up so quickly so I could even the score. Nevertheless, I do wish the whole barter aspect had been left unspoken. It tarnished what should have been 309 a generous sharing on both sides. Tarnish always wears off on the tarnisher. When you do someone a favor and they obviously owe you one, wait a few weeks. Dont make it look like tit for tat. Allow the favor asker the pleasurable myth that you joyfully did the favor with no thought of what youre going to get in return. They know thats not true. You know thats not true. But only little losers make it obvious. The next three techniques also involve timing, not of favors, but of important discussions. Technique #82 Tit for (Wait . . . Wait) Tat When you do someone a favor and its obvious that he owes you one, wait a suitable amount of time before asking him to pay. Let him enjoy the fact (or fiction) that you did it out of friendship. Dont call in your tit for their tat too swiftly. How to Know What Not to Say at Parties When police were hot on the tail of a thief in ancient times, hed frantically seek a church to duck into. The crook knew if he could get to an altar, the frustrated posse could not arrest him until he came out. When a pack of wolves in the jungle is in hot pursuit of a jackrabbit, the frightened bunnys eyes seek a hollow log. He knows the wolves cant devour him until he emerges. Likewise in the human jungle, big cats have certain safe havens. Although unspoken, they are as secure as the tenth-century altar or a hole in the log. At clearly understood times and places, even the toughest tiger knows he must not attack. I call these safe havens. I have a friend, Kirstin, the president of an advertising agency who each year invites me to her companys Christmas party. One year, the holiday spirit was in extra-high swing. Conviviality was high and champagne flowed freely. It was a terrific bash. The evening wore on, more bubbly flowed, and the decibel level of the holiday revelers went up and up. So high, in fact, that Kirstin told me she was going to tiptoe out the back door and offered to drop me off at my place. 311 As we were making our way toward the exit, we heard a woozy voice in the crowd, Oh Kirrr-stin, Kirrr-stin! A mail-room worker, warped with too much seasonal spirit, wobbled up to her boss and said, You know, thish ish a great party, a grr-reat party. But I been doin some figuring. If half what it cost went into a child-care facility for the seven, count em, seven mothers with preschool children who work here . . . Kirstin, a top communicator, took Janes hands in hers and gave her a big smile. She said, Jane, youre obviously excellent at math. Youre right, just about half of what this party cost would indeed pay for the opening of such a facility. Lets talk about it during business hours. We then made a swift departure. On the way back to my place, she let out a big breath and said, Whew, Im glad thats over. Didnt you enjoy the party, Kirstin? I asked. Well, sure, she said, But you never know whats going to happen. For instance, she said, that remark Jane made. She went on to explain management had already had several meetings about opening a child-care facility for employees. In fact, plans for turning an unused storage area into a beautiful nursery were already in the works. Na•vely, I asked Kirstin why she hadnt metioned that to Jane. It wasnt the right time or place. Kirstin had handled the siuation at the party the way any big winner wouldno spoken confrontation now (but probable silent condemnation later). Jane, unfortunately, had broken the first unspoken safe-haven rule, Parties Are for Pratter. Did Kirstin chastise Jane? Did she punish her inappropriate behavior? Not then, of course. Nevetheless, Jane would probably feel the repercussions a few months down the pike when it came to promotion time. But by then poor Jane wouldnt even know why she was passed over. Will it be because of a one-time overimbibing? Jane might grumble, Yes. Jane is wrong. Its simply that big players cant take How to Know What Not to Say at Parties 313 the chance that one of their key people will feel too much holiday spirit at another party and next time confront an important client. Lets move to the second safe haven where big cats can escape the claws of bigger cats and, they hope, the growls of lesser ones. Technique #83 Parties Are for Pratter There are three sacred safe havens in the human jungle where even the toughest tiger knows he must not attack. The first of these is parties. Parties are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations. Big players, even when standing next to their enemies at the buffet table, smile and nod. They leave tough talk for tougher settings. How to Know What Not to Say at Dinner Did you ever wonder why business lunches between big bosses go on interminably long, sometimes well into the afternoon? Did you ever suspect its just because they like to sit, drink, and massage each other on the company expense account? Perhaps theres an element of that. But the main reason is because the dining table is an even more sacred safe haven than a party. Big boys and big girls realize, whether its a business dinner, lunch, or breakfast, breaking bread together is a time when they must discuss no unpleasant aspects of the business. After all, tough negotiating can kill your appetite. Lets listen in on an average business lunch between big plaers. We hear the clanking of glasses as they consume drinks over convivial conversation. They are discussing golf, the weather, and making general observations about the state of the business. Duing the main course, the discourse turns to food, the arts, current affairs, and other nonthreatening subjects. Wasted time? one might ask. Not at all! The big players are watching each others moves very carefully, calculating each others skills, knowledge, prowess. Like NFL scouts observing college football practice, theyre determining whos got the right stuff. Big 314 How to Know What Not to Say at Dinner 315 players know how people handle themselves at a social occasion is an accurate barometer of their big-business muscle. As they are smiling and laughing at each others jokes, they are all making silent critical judgments. Finally, coffee arrives. At this point one or more of the biggies gently broaches the business at hand. Naturally, he or she does it with supposed reluctance, trying to repress the obvious relief that at last they can get down to significant stuff. He exudes, What a shame such genial company should have to concern itself with mundane matters like making money. Only after they have played out this crucial charade can they discuss business. But no dirty business. The biggies can brainstorm over coffee. They can discuss proposals over dessert. They can toss around new ideas over cordials. They can explore the positive side of the merger, the acquisition, or the partnership while waiting for the check. However, should any disagreement, misunderstanding, or controversial aspect arise, they must immediately relegate it to another table, the conference table. Technique #84 Dinners for Dining The most guarded safe haven respected by big winners is the dining table. Breaking bread together is a time when they bring up no unpleasant matters. While eating, they know its OK to brainstorm and discuss the positive side of the business: their dreams, their desires, their designs. They can free associate and come up with new ideas. But no tough business. This convention probably arose out of a prudent agreement not to inflict indigestion on each other. Tough negotiating is unpalatable and can ruin an otherwise perfectly mouthwatering veal chop. Incidentally, the same rule applies in the social jungle. If one partner in a friendship or a love relationship has some heavy reltionship issues to discuss, save them for after dessert. Even if you dont solve the problem, you want to enjoy the delicious chocolate soufflŽ. Lets crawl into our third and final safe haven to explore it. How to Know What Not to Say in a Chance Meeting William, who sells widgets, has been trying to get Big Winner on the phone for weeks to see if B.W.s company will buy his line of widgets. Big Winner is still considering Willies widgets and plans eventually to return his call. However, at this point in our story, our little heros phone has not rung. It just so happens, one evening Willie finds himself standing behind Big Winner in the supermarket line. What good fortune! thinks Willie. Oh hell! thinks Big Winner. I hope hes not going to hit me with talk of his widgets at this hour. Those who appreciate safe havens know there are two very different endings to this story. The Willie who brings up widgets with an Aha, Ive got you now gleam in his eye, never gets his call returned. Even if Big Winner preferred Willies widgets above all others, he would find the supermarket entrapment sufficiently painful to punish the little loser. However, the Willie who just says Hello there, B.W. How good to see you, with nary a word of widgets, shows hes a big player, too. This Willie will most certainly get his call returned probably the next dayout of Big Winners relief and gratitude for Willies graciousness. 317 Technique #85 Chance Encounters Are for Chitchat If youre selling, negotiating, or in any sensitive communication with someone, do NOT capitalize on a chance meeting. Keep the melody of your mistaken meeting sweet and light. Otherwise, it could turn into your swan song with Big Winner. Consistently create safe havens for people if you want them to elevate you to the status of big winner. You may find yourself dining with them, going to parties with them, getting big hellos in the hall, and closing deals much faster than during business hours. Who knows? If its your desire, you even make yourself elgible for some heavy socializing at the top. Big winners make it safe for each other to accept invitations to play golf, spend the weekend in their country homes, or relax by each others pools. They know there will be no sharks swimming in the water, no razor blades buried in the shrimp cocktail. How to Prepare Them to Listen to You Once night, several years ago on a New York City street, I caught a man trying to break into a car. I shouted for him to stop. Instead of being content escaping, the burly would-be burglar decided to retaliate. As he raced past me, he shoved me down onto the cement and I cracked my skull against the curb. Dizzily, I wobbled into the emergency room of a nearby hopital. Holding an ice pack against my throbbing head, I was grilled by the emergency room triage nurse on my address, telephone, and social security numbers, insurance carrier, policy number, ad naseam. Its as if she had said,The heck with your cracked skull. You can tell me about that later. Whats your insurance number? Dont bother me with that minutiae! All I wanted to do was tell somebody, anybody, what happened to me. It wasnt until the very end of her ruthless and sadistic interrogation that she asked, So what happened? I later told my sad story to a friend, Sue, a nurse who works in admitting in another emergency room. She said, I know. I cant believe they print the forms that way. Injured people dont get to tell what happened to them until the last line of the form. Sue said getting crucial numerical details from people suffering in the ER with broken bones and burns was a real challenge. Until, she said, 319 she switched her questioning around. Shed first ask them what happened. Theyd tell her all about it. Shed listen sympathetically. Then, she said, they were only too happy to give me the infomation I needed. Good bosses understand this human need to talk. Robert, a colleague of mine who owns a small manufacturing firm, says whenever one of his employees complains about a problem, he never holds the gripers feet to the fire for facts first. He hears the employee out completely. He lets him carry on about the cantakerous customer, the uncooperative coworker. Then, after hes gotten it off his chest, Robert says, I get the facts a lot more clearly. When You Have Important Information to Impart Any kid working in a garage knows you cant pump more gas into a full tank. Too much topping it off, and it splashes onto the cement. Likewise, your listeners brain is always full of his or her own thoughts, worries, and enthusiasms. If you pump your ideas into your listeners brain, which is full of her own notions, youll get a polluted mixture, then a spill. If you want your supersupreme ideas to flow into her tank unpolluted, drain her tank completely first. Technique #86 Empty Their Tanks If you need information, let people have their entire say first. Wait patiently until their needle is on empty and the last drop drips out and splashes on the cement. Its the only way to be sure their tank is empty enough of their own inner noise to start receiving your ideas. How to Prepare Them to Listen to You 321 Whenever you are discussing emotionally charged matters, let the speaker finish completely before you jump in. Count to ten if you must. It will seem like an eternity, but letting the flustered felow finish is the only way hell hear you when its your turn. Im Going to Make You Miserable Before You Can Enjoy Being My Customer Companies that run mail-order operations could take a hint from this technique. One reason I enjoy ordering from L.L. Bean, a mail-order clothing and sports-equipment outfit, is they let me ask questions about the wearable or widget I want first. They let me ramble on with my questions about the quality, the available coors, how it looks, how it feels, how it smells, and how it works. Then, when Im all whacked up about receiving my four size-ten, red-and-chartreuse, soft, odorless widgets, they tastefully ask my credit card number. Other companies have first grilled me on the number, the expiration date, my customer number (which I can never find on the back of the catalogue), and how often Ive ordered from them in the past before I even get to fantasize about the wonderful widget I might want to buy from them. Takes all the joy out of the purchase and sometimes kills the sale. Top communicators do more than just let you babble on. They use the next technique while youre in the process of dribling down. How to Turn Their Anger Around (in Three Sentences or Less) Emo is a word invented by Helen Gurley Brown, the grand dame of Cosmopolitan magazine. Emo translated is Give more emotion! Once Cosmopolitan asked me to write an article on communicaing sensitive matters (most specifically advising young women on how to make their boyfriends more passionate). I interviewed a passel of psychologists, communications experts, and sexologists. My draft came back from Cosmo all marked up with MORE EMO scribbled on every page. I called my editor and asked what it meant. She said that was Helens way of saying downplay all that factual stuff with the sex therapists and so-called experts. Write about the emotion the young woman feels when her boyfriend isnt passionate enough, the emtion the accused male feels when confronted, and the emotion the couple feels about discussing their quandary. Helen Gurley Brown, a certified big winner, liked to have it all and knew just how to get it. Helen recognized, when the time is right, reject the rational and empathize with the emotions. In other words, smear on the emo. Oh, No! He Must Have Been Mortified! L.L. Bean recently smeared emo all over me. Several months ago, my friend Phil wanted to buy some trousers and asked for a rec322 How to Turn Their Anger Around (in Three Sentences or Less) 323 ommendation. I dragged him to my closet to show him the quaity and construction of the L.L. Bean clothes. That convinced him, and Phil ordered a pair of navy-blue dress trousers. Phil wore his brand new L.L. Bean pants for the first time on a big date with a new girlfriend at an elegant restaurant. While following the ma”tre d to the cozy corner booth which hed requested, his date happened to drop her evening bag. Phil promptly bent over to pick it up. Riiiiiiip! Right down the midle seam. Most of the diners facing Phils derriere mercifully looked away. A few tittered. Phil, tugging the torn seams together to blaket his buns, backed his way into the booth. The cool upholstery on his bottom the rest of the evening reminded him of his humiliation. When I heard of Phils tribulations, I was furious at L.L. Bean. I immediately called one of their customer service agents. She sypathized as I told her of Phils ordeal, but I was still simmering. She patiently listened and even asked me details of the disaster. When I finished the long sad story, the agent said, Oh thats terible. I understand, your friend must have felt awful. Yes, he did, I agreed. He must have been mortified! she said. He definitely was, I said, surprised at her excellent grasp of the situation. And you, when you heard about it. You must have felt terrible, too, especially after youd recommended our products so highly. Well, your products usually are excellent, I said, calming down a bit. Im so sorry we caused you this pain and aggravation, she said. Oh, I interrupted. Its not your fault. Now I was copletely appeased. It must have just been a fluke that this one pair of pantswas... Technique #87 Echo the Emo Facts speak. Emotions shout. Whenever you need facts from people about an emotional situation, let them emote. Hear their facts but empathize like mad with their emotions. Smearing on the emo is often the only way to calm their emotional storm. Theres more to this story, but let me pause here to interject the Echo the Emo technique. The clever customer service rep not only emptied my tanks and softened me up with Echo the Emo. She completely dissolved me with the next technique. How to Make Em Like You (Even When Youve Messed Up) The next day, UPS delivered not only the replacement slacks, but tucked into the package was a handwritten apology and a hefty gift certificate. Would I order from that company again? You bet I would. Would I recommend their clothes to someone else? You bet I would. Top customer service folks welcome mistakes because they know it gives their firm a chance to shine. Whenever you mess up and someone suffers because of it, make sure they come out ahead, way ahead. I call the technique My Goof, Your Gain. Visiting an important clients office, I once tripped on a rug and took a nose dive, making a three-point landing in a vase on her desk. My nose was spared but her vase shattered into smithereens. Two tubes of crazy glue and lots of Where the heck does this piece go later, the vase was back on her desk, and we agreed it looked pretty good. Nevertheless, the next day I had a messenger deliver a beautiful vase, ten times the value of the almost-totaled one, with a dozen roses in it. Whenever we speak, my client tells me every time she looks at the new vase, she smiles. (A better incentive gift than a pen with your name on it, no?) The next time I visit her office, my client may hide some of her more valuable breakables. But, thanks to My Goof, Your Gain, there will be a next time. 325 Technique #88 My Goof, Your Gain Whenever you make a boner, make sure your victim benefits. Its not enough to correct your mistake. Ask yourself, What could I do for this suffering soul so he or she will be delighted I made the flub? Then do it, fast! In that way, your goof will become your gain. Now, suppose its not your boo-boo. Its theirs. How can you make their goof your gain? Read on. How to Trap a Rat with Class In Japan, some citizens prefer to lose their lives rather than to lose face. In America, the same death wish exists, with one modifiction. The Yank dreams of the death of the mortal who made him lose face. Why make enemies? Unless it is your obligation to catch cheaters or entrap liars, let them get away with it. Then immedately get them out of your life and the lives youre responsible for. Even when the case is open and shut against someonewhen youve got the rat fink trappedleave him an escape hatch. The best example I heard of this high sensitivity was from one of my clients. She was invited to brunch at the home of a wealthy socialite known as Lady Stephanie. Lady Stephanies home was filled with beautiful objets dart. Not the least among them was an exquisite collection of extremely valuable FabergŽ eggs, which all the guests admired. At the end of the elegant champagne brunch, my client told me she was walking out the door chatting with several other guests. Just then, Lady Stephanie sidled up to one woman leaving at the same time as my client. Oh, Im so happy you were admiing my FabergŽ collection, Lady Stephanie said, sliding her hand into the pocket of the guests mink coat and plucking out one of 327 her priceless eggs. You must have wanted to see this one in the sunlight. Come, let us look at it together. It does reflect the bright light beautifully. The mink-clad thief gulped and furtively looked around to see who had witnessed her gentle entrapment. My client and everyone in the foyer saw what happened, but took Lady Stephanies lead and pretended na•vetŽ of the attempted heist. Carrying the charade a step further, Lady Stephanie and the sticky-fingered guest admired the egg in the sunlight. Then Lady Stephanie, with her FabergŽ egg secured safely between her pefectly manicured fingers, marched home to put the treasure in its rightful place. The attempted egg snatcher crawled back to her car, from her last attendance at Lady Stephanies coveted bashes. The hostess let the foiled filcher get away with a few slivered shreds of her ego left intact. Why did Lady Stephanie come out ahead? Everyone who winessedand subsequently heard aboutthe thwarted burglary has renewed respect for Lady Stephanie. Snaring the thief, yet sparing her pride, helped Lady Stephanie keep her reputation of hostess with the mostest. Why do big winners let bad-news people get away with bumers? Because, like mothers confronting naughty children to corect them, confronting creeps is a way of saying I care. By closing your mouth (and then the door forever), you are saying, You are so beneath me Im not going to even waste my words on you. Mea Culpa! Big winners leave an escape hatch for the small foibles of friends they wish to keep by taking the blame themselves. If a friend gets lost and is an hour late arriving at your house, tell her Those directions I gave you were terrible. He breaks your Limoges bowl? Oh I shouldnt have left it in such a precarious position. Its the How to Trap a Rat with Class 329 old mea culpa routine that endears you to everyone, especially when they realize it wasnt your fault. Residents of Toronto, Canada, have a well-earned reputation for grace. They demonstrated it last year in a downtown Toronto drugstore. A shopper attempted to stroll out through the security system with a purloined object in his pocket. Instead of a shrill alarm shattering all shoppers eardrums, as in many American cities, a tasteful little chime sounded. A charming voice came across the public address. Excuse us, we have failed to inactivate the inventory control system. Thank you for your patience while you wait for a customer care representative to come help you. Isnt that a nicer way of saying Freeze, punk, while we come frisk you? Now lets move on to the next technique to keep people from messing upand to help them give you their very best. Technique #89 Leave an Escape Hatch Whenever you catch someone lying, filching, exaggeating, distorting, or deceiving, dont confront the dirty duck directly. Unless it is your responsibility to catch or correct the culpritor unless you are saving other innocent victims by doing solet the transgressor out of your trap with his tricky puss in one piece. Then resolve never to gaze upon it again. How to Get Whatever You Want from Service Personnel A complimentary letter is called a buttercup because it butters up the recipient. Buttercups are nice. Even nicer are buttercups about someone to their boss. I once needed a massive photocopying job. It was so immense that the assistant manager of Staples office-supply store didnt think it could be finished by the end of the week. Nevertheless, grudgingly, he grumbled, Ill try. In my enthusiasm and hope he could, I gushed, Wow, youre great! Whats your bosss name? Your supervisor should get a letter of congratulations on hiring you. You really try harder for your customers. To my astonis ment, not only was my printing job done two days early, but every time I walk into Staples, the assistant manager rolls out the red carpet. Hmm, I began to think. I may be on to something. A prmature letter of commendation for favors not yet received could be a clever tactic. I decided to check it out with a few heavy hiters on my consultation list. One fellow I know, Tim, a top travel agent, is a real can-do guy. He gets anything his friends ask for in a finger snap. Hes the fellow to call when you want hard-to-get theater tickets. Hes the 330 How to Get Whatever You Want from Service Personnel 331 guy you call when your airline says the hotel is booked or the flight is oversold. When I told him of my buttercup experience, Tim laughed and said, Leil, of course. This is news to you? A complimentary letter to someones bossor the promise of oneis a great insu ance policy. Its as good as a written rider that you will be well taken care of in the future. Now I have a standard one in my computer. The buttercup reads as follows: Dear [name of supervisor], I know how important customer service is to an organization such as yours. This letter is to comend [name of employee]. He/She is an example of an [employee title] who gives exceptional customer service. [Name of store or business] continues to have my business thanks in great part to the service given by [name of employee]. Gratefully, [signature] Ive sent this letter to supervisors of parking lots, owners of insurance companies, and to managers of dozens of stores where I shop regularly. Im sure thats why I never need to worry about getting a parking place when the lot is full, an immediate callback from my insurance agent, and attentive service at my regular shoping haunts. But be careful! Dont just ask, Whats the name of your supervisor? Hearing those words can make an employee as nerous as a turkey in November. Be sure to couch it in a compliment. Say something like, Wow, you are terrific. Whats your supervsors name? Id like to write him or her a letter. Then write it! Youll forever be a VIP in his or her book. Teechnique #90 Buttercups for Their Boss Do you have a store clerk, accountant, law firm junior partner, tailor, auto mechanic, ma”tre d, massage therapist, kids teacheror any other worker you want special attention from in the future? The surefire way to make them care enough to give you their very best is send a buttercup to their boss. The next technique tells you how to stand out as a VIP when youre in a group. How to Be a Leader in a Crowd, Not a Follower During the McCarthy era, government spies infiltrated undeground political rallies to determine who was dangerous to national security. The agents were trained applause watchers. They photographed and investigated men who clapped first, shouted Bravo the loudest, and smiled the longest at the end of politically inflammatory speeches. The spies dubbed those the dangerous ones. The infiltrators felt first responders were confdent cats who had the power to persuade followers and the charisma to lead crowds. In less politically sensitive gatherings, the same principle applies. People who respond first to a presentation or happening, without looking around to see how everyone else is reacting, are men and women of leadership caliber. Cool Cats Clap First You are sitting in an auditorium with hundreds of fellow emploees listening to the president of your firm introduce a new cocept. As youre slouching anonymously in the audience, you think your expression is invisible to the man or woman at the podium. Not so! As a speaker, I guarantee you every one of my colleagues 333 sees every smile, every frown, every light in every eye, and every emblem of extraordinary human intelligence flashing back at him or her. Likewise, the company president making a presentation aniously surveys his corporate jungle and, from the pusses peering back at him, senses which employees are sympathetic and which are not. He also knows which in the sea of faces floating in front of him has the potential to be a heavy hitter like himself. How? Because heavy hitters, even when they do not agree with the speaker, support the podium pontificator. Why? Because they know what its like to be on. They know, no matter how big or litle the cat at the front of the room is, when giving a speech hes concerned about the crowds acceptance. When the company big shot delivers his last line, carefully contrived to bring the crowd to its feet or employees to acquiecence, do you think hes unaware of who starts the trickle, or the riptide, of acceptance? No way! Though his head is down while taking a bow, with the insight of a McCarthy-era spy, he perceives Technique #91 Lead the Listeners No matter how prominent the big cat behind the podium is, crouched inside is a little scaredy-cat who is anxious about the crowds acceptance. Big winners recognize youre a fellow big winner when they see you leading their listeners in a positive reaction. Be the first to applaud or publicly commend the man or woman you agree with (or want favors from). How to Be a Leader in a Crowd, Not a Follower 335 precisely who inaugurated the applause, precisely how long after the last words were uttered, and precisely how enthusiastically! Being the first to put your hands together, being the first to jump to your feet, and, if appropriate, being the first to shout Bravo, gets you big cat status with the tiger who was talking. Be the first clapper no matter how small the crowd, no mater how informal the talk. Dont wait to see how everyone else is going to respond. Even if its a small group of three or four peple standing around, be the first to empathize with the speakers ideas, the first to mutter good idea. Its proof positive youre a person who trusts his or her own instincts. How to Make All the Right Moves Any minute, any second, football fans know the score. Even beeguzzling Big George, dozing in front of the TV set on football Sunday knows. Poke his pudgy pot, and in a wink, hell tell you whos winning, whos losing, and by precisely how many points. Key players in the game of life are like George. Even when you think theyre dozing, they are constantly aware of the score between themselves and everyone in their lifefriends and faily included! They know who is winning, who is losing, and by how many points. When two Japanese businessmen meet, its obvious who is on top. You measure it in millimeters from how close to the floor their noses come when bowing. (Bottom mans nose dives lower.) In America, we dont have carefully choreographed bows showing the score in a relationship. But boys n girls in the busness big league know who is top dog and who is bottom dog today. (It can change tomorrow.) Bottom dog must curtsy deeper. He or she must show defeence. Bottom dog must offer to meet at top dogs office, pick up the restaurant tab when appropriate, and be respectful of top dogs time. If bottom dog fails to show the proper deference, he doesnt 336 How to Make All the Right Moves 337 get his nose rubbed into the ground. He simply disqualifies hiself to bark in the big league. Thats what happened to my girlfriend Laura, who had deveoped the healthy milkshake. (Remember her from Instant Replay?) When we last left Laura, she was blowing her chances with Fred, the top banana of a supermarket chain, by grilling him for details of his mailing address, complaining her pen was out of ink, maing him wait while she got another, writing numbers down wrong, ad nauseam. I didnt tell you the worst part. After Fred was generous enough to invite Laura to send him samples of her health shake, she dropped another bomb by asking him which shipping service she should use. He must have said FedEx because I heard Laura say, Well, my milkshake needs to stay refrigerated. Does FedEx have refrigerated trucks? At this point I knew she had strangled the deal by her own phone chord. She shouldnt nudge Supermarket Czar with dinky shipping details. In fact, Laura should be so grateful, she should personally deliver the drink the next dayrolling it all the way to his supermarket with her nose if need be. Laura was obviously not aware of The Great Scorecard in the Sky. That day the tally was Fred everything, Laura nothing. Big winnersbefore putting pen to paper, fingers to keboard, mouth to phone, or hand to someone elses to shake it do a quick calculation. They ask themselves Who has the most to benefit from this relationship? What has each of us done recently that demands deference from the other? And what can I do to even the score? Friends Keep Tabs Too The Great Scorecard in the Sky is not just bobbing over busnesspeople. If family members and friends look carefully over their loved ones heads, theyll spot it. And, like an over-the-counter stock, it goes up or down every day. When you mess up, you have to even your score by doing more for the one who didnt. To keep love alive, keep your eye on The Great Scorecard in the Sky. Several months ago, I met a nice chap named Charles at a covention. We started discussing our favorite foods. His was hommade linguine with pesto sauce. I liked Charles and I make a mean pesto sauce. The remarkable coincidence of these two elements emboldened me to invite him to dinner at my place. Great, he said. We set it for seven-thirty the following Tuesday. Tuesday afternoon, I begin preparations for the big date. The cuckoo clock on the wall monitored my progress. At five cuckoos, I run to the store to find pine nuts. By six cuckoos, Im back home grinding basil and garlic. At seven cuckoos, Im folding napkins, setting the table, pulling out fresh candles. Whoops, running late. I change clothes and spruce myself up. When seven-thirty strikes, I am all ready. The pesto and I await his arrival. Eight oclock rolls around and no friend. Well, I figure, Ill open the wine and let it breathe. Another hour passes and no Charles. The cuckoo calls me cuckoo nine times now. I begin to believe the bird. It is evident Charles isnt coming. I have been stood up. The next day Charles called with halfhearted apologies and a semiplausible excuse. His car broke down. Gee, Im sorry, I said. (I wanted to say, Did Martians capture you? Were you tranported to another planet where there were no phones to call me? I resisted the sarcasm.) However, he did sound contrite so I was almost willing to forget it. Until his next question. He obviously wasnt aware of how hed slipped in The Great Scorecard in the Sky because, instead of inviting me for linguine with pesto at a fine Italian restaurant to make up for his blooper, he asked, When can we reschedule at your house? Never, Charlie. How to Make All the Right Moves 339 Technique #92 The Great Scorecard in the Sky Any two people have an invisible scorecard hovering above their heads. The numbers continually fluctuate, but one rule remains: player with lower score pays deference to player with higher score. The penalty for not keeping your eye on The Great Scorecard in the Sky is to be thrown out of the game. Permanently. Your Destiny Weve met many people in How to Talk to Anyone. A few of their names are changed, but each is very real. Recently, I decided to track down some of the folks with whom Id crossed paths over the years. I wanted to see what theyre up to now. Laura, my old friend who dreamed of milkshake millions but ignored the Supermarket Czars scorecard, is now back at her day job. Sam, who ruffled me by not revealing he wanted me to speak for his organization, no longer has one. Sonny, who hounded his brother-in-laws cousin by a too-quick call, is still pumping gas. Tania, who insisted on immediate tit for tat, no longer has that terrific job at the talent agency. Poor Jane, the mail-room clerk who confronted her boss at the Christmas party five years ago, is still wrapping packages. And Dan, who left the prolonged inspirational message on his phone, now has an unlisted numbernot a good sign for an aspiring speaker. Whereas Barry who asks everyone he calls, What Color Is Your Time? was recently chosen Broadcaster of the Year by the National Association of Talk Show Hosts. Joe, who keeps note of everyone on his Business Card Dossier, is now a state senator. Jimmi, the expert at Eyeball Selling, was recently written up in Success magazine. Steve, whose staff insinuates Oh Wow, Its You! to every caller, is one of the most requested speakers on the cable circuit. Tim, the can-do guy who gets what he wants from worers in every industry by writing Buttercups for Their Boss, now owns the travel agency. And Gloria, my hairdresser who gives the great Nutshell RŽsumŽ, recently opened a salon on New Yorks fashionable Fifth Avenue. Does this mean to say that just because the first folks irked me and a few others they were exiled to a humdrum existence? And the latter group who made people smile would attain great heights? Of course not. Those isolated moments of their lives we examined were but one move of many they made each day. But consider: if you had been who was ruffled by Laura, Sam, Sonny, Tania, Jane, or Dan and they called you, would you feel like extending yourself for them? Probably not. The memory of their ragged dealing would still smart. Whereas if you heard from Barry, Joe, Jimmi, Steve, Tim, or Gloria, happy memories of your exchange would flood over you. Youd want to do whatever you could for them. Multiply your response by many thousands. As we said in the introduction, nobody gets to the top alone. Over the years, the smooth moves of these big winners have captured the hearts and conquered the minds of hundreds of people who helped boost them rung by rung to the top of whatever ladder they chose. How does one become an instinctive smooth mover rather than a ragged rider through life? The answer became blindingly clear one snowy day last winter. Lumbering along a neatly groomed track on cross-country skis, I spotted a Nordic skier swiftly striding toward me in the same trail. I didnt need to observe his high kick or his snazzy diagonal poling to let me know I was obstructing the path of a pro. How to Make All the Right Moves 341 While mustering the energy to lug my throbbing legs out of the track so Super Skier could soar past, he deftly sidestepped out of the groove, leaving the groomed trail all for me. As he whizzed toward me, he slowed slightly, smiled, nodded, and said, Good morning, beautiful day for skiing, isnt it? I appreciated his deference (and insinuation that we were equals on the snow!). I knew he was not thinking Hey look at me. Here I am! but Ahh, there you are. Let me make room for you. As I implied in the opening words of this book, the diffeence in the life success between those two types of thinkers is incalculable. Why was Super Skier able to pull off his move so gracefully? Was he born with the skill? No. His was a deliberate move that grew out of practice. Practice is also the fountainhead of all smooth communictions moves. Excellence is not a single and solitary action. It is the outcome of many years of making small smooth moves, tiny ones like the ninety-two little tricks weve explored in How to Talk to Anyone. These moves create your destiny. Remember, repeating an action makes a habit. Your habits create your character. And your character is your destiny. May success be your destiny.",
