# Koydo 12-Week Product Roadmap

Last Updated: 2026-03-01  
Owner: Product + Engineering

## Principles

- Pricing matrix and curriculum research remain source of truth.
- RevenueCat is the near-term billing control plane; matrix-to-package mapping must stay contract-tested.
- Content quality, rights compliance, and learner outcomes take priority over feature breadth.
- Any future in-house billing platform must be buildable inside Koydo first, then separable as a standalone SaaS product.

## Outcome KPIs (12-week targets)

- `D30 retention`: +20% from current baseline.
- `Weekly active learners`: +30%.
- `Practice -> paid conversion`: +15%.
- `Mean time to first value` (first mastery gain): < 15 minutes.
- `Tutor grounded-answer rate` (with citations): >= 98%.
- `Rights-compliant audiobook coverage`: >= 95% of queued catalog.

## Sprint Plan (Week-by-week)

| Week | Focus | Milestones | Exit Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mastery graph foundations | Skill-node schema, prerequisite edges, importer from module graph | Graph coverage >= 90% of active modules |
| 2 | Diagnostic placement v1 | Adaptive diagnostic flow + initial mastery state | Placement finishes in <= 12 min and writes mastery profile |
| 3 | Error-log remediation loop | Wrong-answer capture -> remediation queue | >= 80% of new errors mapped to remediation tasks |
| 4 | Spaced repetition scheduler | Daily review queue + interleaving rules | Daily queue generated for all active learners |
| 5 | Citation-grounded tutor | "Ask this lesson/book" with evidence snippets | All tutor answers include source reference or explicit uncertainty |
| 6 | Tutor quality harness | Hallucination/accuracy scoring + safety thresholds | Failing prompts blocked from rollout |
| 7 | Audiobook workflow | Chapter playback + checkpoint quiz + progress sync | End-to-end listen -> quiz -> mastery update works |
| 8 | Parent/teacher dashboards | Mastery heatmaps + risk alerts + intervention list | Teacher/parent surfaces available for pilot cohort |
| 9 | Assignment builder | Skill-graph-based assignment composer | Teacher can generate and assign graph-based sets |
| 10 | Offline pack + sync | Download bundle, local attempts, conflict resolution | Core learner loop works offline and syncs cleanly |
| 11 | Cohorts and challenges | Study circles, weekly league scaffolding | Cohort challenge loop available in beta |
| 12 | Creator pipeline pilot | Submission, review rubric, publish gate | At least 3 reviewed creator packs in staging |

## Epics Mapped to Your Feature Set

1. Adaptive mastery map with prerequisites  
2. Spaced repetition + interleaving scheduler  
3. Citation-grounded AI tutor and contradiction checks  
4. Error-log auto-remediation engine  
5. Placement diagnostics and dynamic pathing  
6. Audiobook mode + comprehension checkpoints  
7. Grounded "Ask this lesson/book" Q&A  
8. Teacher/parent dashboards + alerts  
9. Assignment builder from content graph  
10. Offline packs + sync  
11. Cohort challenges / study groups / leagues  
12. Creator submission + review pipeline  
13. AI quality-eval harness (accuracy/hallucination)  
14. Rights/provenance compliance pipeline  
15. Knowledge graph search backbone

## Long-Term (Post-content priority): In-house RevenueCat-compatible Platform

### Initiative

`Project Atlas Billing` (last-priority initiative, starts only after content-scale milestones are stable).

### Why

- Variable-fee reduction at high scale.
- Shared billing core across future Koydo apps.
- Option to productize as external SaaS.

### Non-negotiable requirements

- API and behavior compatibility with current RevenueCat-backed app flows.
- Dashboard parity: offerings, entitlements, packages, customer history, webhook observability.
- Multi-app and multi-tenant support.
- Webhook reliability, replay, idempotency, and audit logs.
- Export/import path for migration from RevenueCat.
- Architecture boundary so the module can run embedded in Koydo or as standalone deployment.

### Phased execution (after primary roadmap)

1. `Spec & compatibility`: define API contracts mirroring current app expectations.
2. `Core services`: products/offerings/entitlements/customer records.
3. `Store adapters`: Apple/Google server notification ingestion.
4. `Dashboard`: operator tools with logs and manual overrides.
5. `Migration`: dual-write/shadow-read with RevenueCat before cutover.
6. `Standalone packaging`: separate deployable service + tenant onboarding.
