/**
 * Centralised asset path constants for Koydo brand images.
 *
 * HOW TO SWAP AN IMAGE:
 *   Option A (no code change) — replace the file in /public/ with the same name.
 *   Option B (change path)    — update the constant below; TypeScript will
 *                               surface every usage across the codebase.
 *
 * All files live in /public/ so Next.js <Image> can serve them optimised.
