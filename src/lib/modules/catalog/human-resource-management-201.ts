Each phase feeds into the next, but the model is iterative — evaluation insights loop back to improve future analysis and design."

(2) Task analysis identifies the specific knowledge, skills, and behaviors required for job performance by examining job descriptions and competency models. (3) Person analysis evaluates individual employees to determine who needs training and what kind. Sources include performance reviews, skills assessments, customer feedback, and error rates. A thorough TNA prevents wasting resources on training that does not address real performance gaps."

E-learning offers scalability and self-pacing for knowledge-based content. On-the-job training (OJT) builds practical skills in real work contexts. Simulations and role-playing develop decision-making under pressure. Microlearning delivers bite-sized modules for just-in-time learning. The choice depends on learning objectives, audience size, budget, and urgency. Blended approaches combining multiple methods typically yield the highest transfer of learning."

While the exact percentages are debated, the core insight is powerful: most learning happens through experience, not classrooms. HR must design development systems that leverage all three channels."

This approach features frequent one-on-one check-ins (weekly or biweekly), real-time feedback, quarterly goal reviews, and forward-looking development conversations rather than backward-looking ratings. The shift was driven by research showing that annual reviews are demotivating, suffer from recency bias, and fail to improve performance. Continuous feedback enables agile course correction and strengthens the manager-employee relationship."

Best practices include using it primarily for development (not compensation decisions), ensuring anonymity for raters, providing professional debriefing, and following up with a development plan."

The manager acts as a career coach — having development conversations, providing stretch assignments, and advocating for direct reports. The organization provides the infrastructure — career paths, development programs, internal job markets, tuition reimbursement, and lateral move opportunities. Career paths are no longer purely vertical ladders; they include lateral moves, cross-functional rotations, and dual career tracks (technical and managerial) that accommodate diverse career aspirations."
