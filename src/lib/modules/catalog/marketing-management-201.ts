When consumers pay $5 for a Starbucks coffee they could make at home for $0.50, the difference reflects brand equity. Kevin Lane Keller's Customer-Based Brand Equity (CBBE) model has four levels: brand identity (who are you?), brand meaning (what are you?), brand response (what do I think/feel about you?), and brand resonance (how connected am I to you?). Resonance — deep loyalty and community — is the ultimate goal."
