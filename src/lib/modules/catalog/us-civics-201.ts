It replaced the Articles of Confederation, which created a central government too weak to collect taxes, regulate trade, or enforce laws. The Founding Fathers met at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787. Their goal: create a government strong enough to function but limited enough to protect individual liberty."

Legislative (Congress: Senate + House of Representatives) makes laws. Executive (President + Cabinet) enforces laws. Judicial (Supreme Court + federal courts) interprets laws. Each branch can check the others: the President can veto Congress's laws, Congress can override a veto with 2/3 vote, and the Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional."

States handle education, driver's licenses, and local law enforcement. The Preamble begins 'We the People' — those three words mean the government's power comes from the citizens, not a king. The Preamble lists six goals: form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for common defense, promote general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty."
