Since we took our first look at the stock markets in 1999, we have been interested to note the lack of work on the financial side of China’s miracle that gets beyond the macroeconomics of things. We are the first to agree that living and working in the country for 25 years may not qualify us as experts in economics. We do believe, however, that our experience has given us a feel for how China’s political elite manages money and the country’s economy.",

Those looking for tales of corruption and princelings with their hands in the till will be disappointed though. We think that the financial side of the story behind a 30-year boom that changed the lives of one billion people is much more interesting; so this is our effort at staking out modern China’s political economy “inside the system.” We do not believe in Chinese exceptionalism.

Visitors from the West had seen nothing like it outside of science fiction movies. In Beijing, the mad rush to put the finishing touches on the Olympic preparations was coming to an end—some 40 million pots of flowers had been laid out along the boulevards overnight.

Rather, we should develop around our own needs and build our own banking system.” Chen Yuan, Chairman, China Development Bank July 2009 In China, the banks are the financial system; nearly all financial risk is concentrated on their balance sheets. China’s heroic savers underwrite this risk; they are the only significant source of capital “inside the system” of the Party-controlled domestic economy. This is the weakest point in China’s economic and political arrangement, and the country’s leaders, in a general way, understand this.",

This model of growth, however, neither assures the long-term sustainable development of the banking sector nor satisfies the need of a balanced economic and social structure. Things are very complicated; so will be the solutions.” Xiao Gang, Chairman, Bank of China August 25, 2010 1 When the Asian Financial Crisis threatened the stability of China’s financial institutions in 1997, Zhu Rongji sponsored a group of reformers surrounding Zhou Xiaochuan, then chairman of the CCB, to come up with a plan. The immediate threat to confidence in the banks was addressed by the MOF injecting new capital into the banks in 1998.",

Such lack of development has also distorted the financing structure and produced considerable implicit risks, whose consequences may be grave for social and economic development.” Zhou Xiaochuan Speech at China Bond Market Development Summit October 20, 2005 The demand from corporations and other issuers for cheaper capital than banks were willing or able to provide gave rise to the debt-capital markets in the developed economies.",

Modeled after the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in the US, asset-management companies (AMCs) would be established for each of the banks. The AMCs would become the “bad” banks holding the non-performing loans (NPLs) of the resulting “good” banks. These bad banks would be financed by the government and be responsible for recovering whatever value possible from NPLs. The State Council approved the proposal and in 1999 the AMCs were set up.

This period began with the appointment of Zhou Xiaochuan to the governorship of the PBOC in early 2002. That year, a total of RMB933 billion (US$113 billion) in bonds, largely Chinese government bonds (CGB) and policy-bank bonds, was issued. By 2009 new issuance had nearly tripled, to RMB2.8 trillion (US$350 billion), and included a large chunk of corporate and bank bonds.",
