Thanks to Hervé This, I discovered that I could live with the pitfalls as long as failure could become a learning experience. What makes microwave heat so different from gas-fired ovens that it causes a tarte Tatin to go all soggy? Why did that soufflé fail to rise, what diabolical chemistry caused my béarnaise to liquefy? Call Hervé This. He is our necessary navigator over microwaves and through formerly murky seas of culinary science. The chef’s domain is a Faustian alchemist’s laboratory.",

            "Cooking and Science Venial Sins, Mortal Sins “Add the cheese béchamel to the egg whites, beaten into stiff peaks, without collapsing them!” Such vague instructions in a soufflé recipe often make amateur cooks nervous. How to avoid collapsing those laboriously beaten egg whites? In our ignorance, we begin by using what we think is a gentle—that is, slow—technique. The egg whites and the béchamel do not mix easily, so we stop before we have a homogeneous blend or we stir the two ingredients so long that the egg whites collapse. In both cases, the effect is the same: the soufflé is ruined. Where does the fault lie? With the cookbook that takes for granted such simple techniques, known to professionals but not sufficiently mastered by the general public?",

The incontrovertible laws of chemistry and physics are here made accessible, and their practical application demonstrated. Why is the crust of bread tastier than the crumb?

What is this world made of? Atoms and molecules in constant motion. What do these molecules look like? That all depends on who imagines them and the framework in which they are placed. To the young chemist’s eyes, they are often groupings of colored spheres that form or disintegrate in flasks, beakers, test tubes ... or soup pots.",

            "Milk How Do We Keep Milk from Boiling Over? One of the major difficulties in science is accurately assessing situations. To what degree can one simplify a system without losing the essence of the phenomenon one wants to understand? To explain how soup is cooled, I compared it to water, because the heat exchanges on the surface, which are solely responsible for the cooling, are identical for soup and water. If we were interested in the properties of flow, only a very watery soup could be compared to water. Like the poet, the physicist and the chemist must be masters of metaphor. To understand why milk boils over, can we also consider it analogous to water? Certainly not, because boiling water does not boil over.",

Beauty is not the only characteristic of aspics. In the mouth, they melt deliciously, leaving behind the quintessence of the flavors sealed within. The gourmand secret in these dishes is in the jelly, whose mysteries have now been revealed to us by physics, prompted by the photography industry. 15 After centuries of empiricism, today’s cooks are now equipped with knowledge of the reasons behind their enchanting gastronomic creations.",

A bit of observation will reveal to us something of its hidden nature: when we let milk stand, what rises to the surface is cream, that is, a fatty substance (since cream, beaten, becomes butter). In what form is cream found in milk? Observing milk under the microscope would reveal to us countless tiny fat droplets (globules), dispersed in a solution. Milk is an emulsion, and by reflecting the light at their surface and also dispersing it, the globules of fatty material dispersed in the water are responsible for the milk’s white color. Naturally, milk is not only water and fat, because the two materials do not mix.",

            "Mayonnaise Mix Oil and Water? You take a bowl, and you pour in oil, then water: two phases separate from each other, the water, which is denser, below; the oil, which is less dense, on top. You whisk it: a few drops of water enter the oil, a few drops of oil go into the water, but as soon as the agitation stops the oil droplets rise again and the water droplets descend. The two phases separate once more. What miracle allows the water in an egg yolk (about half the yolk and about 90 percent of the vinegar) and oil to remain mixed in mayonnaise? The secret of the preparation is in the egg yolk.",

            "The Egg’s Incarnations Essential Accessories The egg is the unrecognized star of cooking. In his Almanach des gourmands , Grimod de la Reynière celebrated it in these terms: “The egg is to cooking as the articles are to speech, that is to say, such an indispensable necessity that the most skillful cook will renounce his art if he is forbidden to use them.” How true! Its whites, beaten into stiff peaks, merit their own chapter. Soufflés, which they cause to rise, require the examination of so many principles of physics that, again, a complete chapter will be necessary if we are to master them. And the hard-boiled egg, though its preparation seems within the range of the least skilled novice, requires much care to be truly good.",

            "Need I say that I will not linger here over the various explanations cookbooks give for why mayonnaise gets ruined? Cookbooks contain much useful information, but they also contain many mistakes arising out of the nonscientific, empirical development of the art. First of all, let us see why oil and water do not mix. Water molecules, composed of an oxygen atom bound simultaneously to two hydrogen atoms, are linked by what are called hydrogen bonds, between an oxygen atom of one water molecule and a hydrogen atom of a neighboring water molecule. On the other hand, oil molecules, or lipids, are snobs that do not associate with water.",
