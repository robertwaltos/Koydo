Happiness does not just make you enjoy life more; it actually affects how successful you are in both your personal life and your professional life. A few years ago Sonja Lyubomirsky at the University of California and her colleagues set about the mammoth task of reviewing hundreds of studies in which experimenters cheered up selected people and then monitored the effects of their subjects’ newfound joy. 1 All sorts of procedures were employed to make participants feel happy, including having them smell fresh-cut flowers, read out positive affirmations (“I really am a good person”), eat chocolate cake, dance, or watch a funny film.",

Many believe that the most effective way is to dangle the biggest possible carrot in front of their noses. But does research suggest this is really an incentive, or is it just a myth? In one famous study, Stanford psychologist Mark Lepper and colleagues asked two groups of schoolchildren to have fun creating some drawings. 1 Before being allowed to play with the crayons and paper, one group was told that they would receive an elaborate “good player” medal for drawing, while the other group was not promised any reward.",

            "Sometimes the experimenters resorted to trickery, telling participants that they had performed especially well on an IQ test or ensuring that they “accidentally” found some money in the street. Regardless of the method used, the overall result was clear—happiness doesn’t just flow from success; it actually causes it. After trawling the data from hundreds of studies involving more than a quarter of a million participants, Lyubomirsky discovered impressive benefits to being happy. Happiness makes people more sociable and altruistic, it increases how much they like themselves and others, it improves their ability to resolve conflict, and it strengthens their immune systems. The cumulative effect means that people have more satisfying and successful relationships, find more fulfilling careers, and live longer, healthier lives.",

When selling his approach to businesses, Osborn claimed that “the average person thinks up twice as many ideas when working with a group than when working alone,” and, perhaps not surprisingly, his novel approach quickly conquered the world. 1 Over the years, organizations around the globe have encouraged their employees to tackle key problems using this approach.",

Imagine, for example, that during a counseling session, a wife explains that she is furious with her husband because he regularly gets drunk, comes home smelling of alcohol, and sits in front of the television late.

          content:
            "THE FAMOUS PSYCHOANALYST Sigmund Freud believed that the psyche is composed of three main components: id, ego, and superego. The “id” is the animalistic portion of your mind that is impulsive and driven by basic instincts, the “superego” represents the more moral side of things, and the “ego” attempts to arbitrate between these two opposing forces. Most of the time, the three parts agree with one another, and all is fine and dandy. However, once in a while, a major disagreement breaks out, and, as is so often the case in life, it usually comes down to sex and violence. To fully appreciate Freud’s idea, imagine locking a horny teenage boy (think id), a priest (superego), and an accountant (ego) in a room with a pornographic magazine.",

          content:
            "WHEN PEOPLE HAVE an important decision to make in the workplace, they often arrange to discuss the issues with a group of well-informed and levelheaded colleagues. On the face of it, that seems a reasonable plan. After all, when you’re making up your mind, it is easy to imagine that consulting people with a variety of backgrounds and expertise could provide a more considered and balanced perspective. But are several heads really better than one? Psychologists have conducted hundreds of experiments on this issue, and their findings have surprised even the most ardent supporters of group consultations.",

            "The teenager, representing the animalistic side, would jump on the magazine, while the priest would attempt to rip it out of his immoral grasp and dispose of it. The accountant would then face an uphill struggle getting them to agree on the best way forward. Eventually, all three would calm down, discuss the issue, and perhaps decide that it would be best to pretend that the magazine didn’t exist. That way, the teenager wouldn’t be tempted to look at the naughty photographs, and the priest wouldn’t have to lecture constantly about the importance of morality. Happy with the clever compromise, the three hide the magazine under the carpet and try to forget about it. Unfortunately, that is easier said than done.",
