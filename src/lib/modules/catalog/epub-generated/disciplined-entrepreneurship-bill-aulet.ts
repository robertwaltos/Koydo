One of the first questions I often ask when I begin a workshop or a class is, “Do you think entrepreneurship can be taught?” Invariably a silence comes over the group. They wiggle uncomfortably in their seats. Some politely answer in the affirmative, telling me that is why they came to class in the first place. After a polite back-and-forth someone will invariably say what is on the mind of many in the room: “No, either you are an entrepreneur or you are not.” That person, once empowered, begins to passionately argue the case. I have to say that I tend to like this person, in large part because that person would have been me 15 years ago.",

Some students have worked in one industry for years and want a change. Some want to push their skills to the maximum and have the biggest impact on the world. Some want to be their own boss. Some hold patents and are interested in the different ways they can commercialize them. Some have an idea about how their own life could be improved and they wonder if that idea is interesting to others.",

When we look at Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, and all the other highly visible entrepreneurs, they seem to be different from us. They seem extraordinary. But each of their successes is a result of great products that made them successful, not some special gene. To be a successful entrepreneur, you must have great and innovative products. Products can be physical goods, but also services or the delivery of information. All the other factors that influence success are nothing without a product. And the process of making a great product can be taught.",
