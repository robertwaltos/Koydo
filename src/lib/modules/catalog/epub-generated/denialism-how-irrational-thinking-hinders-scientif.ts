            "INTRODUCTION Ten years ago, while walking through Harvard Yard, I saw a student wearing a button that said “Progressives against Scientism.” I had no idea what that meant, so I asked him. Sci entism, he explained, is the misguided belief that scientists can solve problems that nature can’t. He reeled off a series of technologies that demonstrated the destructiveness of what he called the “scientific method approach” to life: genetically modified foods, dams, nuclear power plants, and pharmaceuticals all made the list. We talked for a few minutes, then I thanked him and walked away. I didn’t understand how science might be responsible for the many scars humanity has inflicted upon the world, but students have odd intellectual infatuations, and I let it slip from my mind.",

It is no longer necessary to hunt for a small co-op if you want to buy organic peanut butter or grass-fed beef, of course. Thousands of stores offer organic and “natural” products, and sales are growing at several times the rate of more conventional fare, even in the midst of a recession.

But whose had not? I try to eat properly, exercise regularly, sleep peacefully, and generally adhere to the standard conventions of fitness. It didn’t seem to be working. My doctor found nothing wrong and my blood tests were fine. Still, I felt strange, as if I were lacking in energy—or in something. So I did what millions of Americans do every day.

Minorities living in America’s largest cities visit the emergency room more often, spend more time in the hospital, and die in far greater numbers from asthma than the rest of the population; they are also far more likely to develop pneumonia and other pulmonary diseases. None of that was news to most of those who attended the meeting, but the CDC study was the first to focus specifically on the prevalence of asthma in Hispanics.",

Although artemisinin has become the world’s most important malaria medicine, Keasling wasn’t up on infectious diseases. But he happened to be in the process of creating a new discipline, synthetic biology, which, by combining elements of engineering, chemistry, computer science, and molecular biology, seeks nothing less than to assemble the biological tools necessary to redesign the living world. No scientific achievement—not even splitting the atom—has promised so much, and none has come with greater risks or clearer possibilities for deliberate abuse.",

Many people in the audience found that odd; differences in the rates of pulmonary disease are often a result of social conditions, the environment, and disparities in the quality of health care. Poor people rarely receive the best possible treatments and consequently they don’t do as well as richer patients—with asthma or with most other illnesses.

In particular, I would like to thank Daniel Zalewski and Meghan O’Rourke. Somehow, they each found time to read chapters, and then provide detailed suggestions for how to make them better. My friend Richard Brody read the book as I wrote it, with great enthusiasm but a stern eye for faulty logic and broken sentences. Suzy Hansen served not only as an able fact checker, but also as a demanding reader. Any mistakes that survived her attention—or anyone else’s—are my fault completely. At the Penguin Press, Ann Godoff and Vanessa Mobley embraced the book from the moment I spoke to them about it.",

I will put footnotes on my Web site, www.michaelspecter.com . I thought it might be useful here to point out at least some of the sources I found particularly compelling. Traditional journalists (a category that includes me) tend to deride blogs as so much unedited and contradictory noise. That’s often true; but some of the most insightful science writing in America can be found on blogs these days—and I was lucky to have them at my disposal.",

I don’t know what more a writer could ask. I am also indebted to Nicole Hughes, Tracy Locke, Caroline Garner, and Leigh Butler, who doubles as a longtime friend. Many friends have heard me drone on about this subject for years—encouraging me all the while. (And also arguing—which I tend to see as the same thing.) For their support and good cheer I would like to thank Gary Kalkut, Esther Fein, Gerry Krovatin, Sarah Lyall, Robert McCrum, Anne McNally, Richard Cohen, John Kalish, Jacob Weisberg, Deborah Needleman, Jacob Lewis, Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki and Alessandra Stanley.",
