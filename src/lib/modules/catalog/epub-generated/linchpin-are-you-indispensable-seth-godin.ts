And yet . . . And yet it's Yo-Yo Ma and Ben Zander and Gustavo Dudamel who are in demand, who make great money, and who are having all the fun.

Standardized News Journalism is another great example, because it's easy to glamorize the profession and easy for people to confuse the value of the final product (honest, insightful news reporting) with the cost of making that product. Media economist Robert Picard said, Well-paying employment requires that workers possess unique skills, abilities, and knowledge. It also requires that the labor must be non-commoditized. Unfortunately, journalistic labor has become commoditized. Most journalists share the same skill sets and the same approaches to stories, seek out the same sources, ask similar questions, and produce relatively similar stories. . . .",

A genius looks at something that others are stuck on and gets the world unstuck. So the question is: Have you ever done that? Have you ever found a shortcut that others couldn't find? Solved a problem that confounded your family? Seen a way to make something work that wasn't working before? Made a personal connection with someone who was out of reach to everyone else?",

            "Even once? No one is a genius all the time. Einstein had trouble finding his house when he walked home from work every day. But all of us are geniuses sometimes. The tragedy is that society (your school, your boss, your government, your family) keeps drumming the genius part out. The problem is that our culture has engaged in a Faustian bargain, in which we trade our genius and artistry for apparent stability. Reality A guy is riding in the first-class cabin of a train in Spain and to his delight, he notices that he's sitting next to Pablo Picasso.
