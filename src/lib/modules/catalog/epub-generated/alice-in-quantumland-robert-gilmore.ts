            "Preface n the first half of the twentieth century, our understanding of the Universe was turned upside down. The old classical theories of physics were replaced by a new way of looking at the world-quantum mechanics. This is in many ways at variance with the ideas of the older Newtonian mechanics; indeed, in many ways it is at variance with our common sense. Nevertheless, the strangest thing about these theories is their extraordinary success in predicting the observed behavior of physical systems. However nonsensical quantum mechanics may at times appear to us, that seems to be the way that Nature wants it-and so we have to play along.",

Just come in.\" Alice tried the door and found it was not locked, so she opened it and walked through. Inside she found herself in a large, dark room.

            "lice walked with the State Agent along the edge of the Void, looking out over the shimmering tenuous surface which was continuously aboil with the activity of the virtual particles as they were born and died unnoticed. A little way out from the shore Alice saw a disturbance in the surface, some sort of circular depression in the general uniform level. Further out she could see other pits, and many of them were clumped together into groups. Some of the groups were very small and contained just a couple of the circular objects. Other collections were more extensive. She could see one group which contained a ring made up of six of the objects arranged in a circle, while others were attached around the outside.",

We are remaining strictly in the vicinity of the atom, but are now somewhat localized in its center or indeed rather more than somewhat. What you see before you is the bottom of the same potential well. Do you not recognize that same item?\" \"No, I certainly do not!\" replied Alice emphatically. \"The potential well was a well ; it was a hole which went downward. This is a tower which goes upward.",

            "In the distance she could see some enormous assemblies spread across the surface. The largest contained many hundreds of the circular things, whatever they might be. As Alice watched, she saw photons soar intermittently from one or another of the shapes which were spread out before her. The brilliantly colored photons looked rather like flares fired from ships at sea. The Agent followed the direction of her gaze. \"I see that you are watching the atoms as they swim in the Vacuum. Atoms provide us with much of our work in the electron state business, one way or another. You can see from here the various molecular partnerships that they have set up between them. These range from small two-atom businesses to huge organic conglomerates.",
