Fifteenth-century Europeans ‘knew’ that the sky was made of closed concentric crystal spheres, rotating around a central earth and carrying the stars and planets. That ‘knowledge’ structured everything they did and thought, because it told them the truth. Then Galileo’s telescope changed the truth. As a result, a hundred years later everybody ‘knew’ that the universe was open and infinite, working like a giant clock. Architecture, music, literature, science, economics, art, politics - everything - changed, mirroring the new view created by the change in the knowledge. Today we live according to the latest version of how the universe functions. This view affects our behaviour and thought, just as previous versions affected those who lived with them.",

Surely a modicum of astronomical good sense would have told them that the reverse was true. Wittgenstein is said to have replied: ‘I agree. But I wonder what it would have looked like if the sun had been circling the earth.’ The point is that it would look exactly the same. When we observe nature we see what we want to see, according to what we believe we know about it at the time.",

And at any time, that view they held was sooner or later altered by changes in the body of knowledge. This book examines some of those moments of change, in order to show how the changes of view also generated major institutions or ways of thought which have since survived to become basic elements of modern life.",

In each of these manifestations we express our difference one from the other, our uniqueness.

Law gives an individual the confidence to explore, to risk, to venture into the unknown, in the knowledge that he, as an innovator, will be protected by society.

            "Credit Where It’s Due It is sometimes difficult to imagine that the world has not always been as we know it today. There have always been mouths to feed and work to do, rules to obey, in the cycle of birth, procreation and death. In the past the crops grew in the ground as they still do. People harvested and ate them. They used the tools they had to shape the world around them as we do. But in many respects the constituents of modern living are very different in nature from what: went before. The differences are profound, and much greater than the similarities. Today it is normal to be a consumer, separated from the producer of the goods we use.",

            "What the Doctor Ordered It is often said that the miracle of modern medicine is best exemplified by the number of old people alive today. Thanks to medical advances the percentage of the population over the age of retirement will shortly exceed those young enough to work. Every day, it seems, a new discovery extends life. The real miracle, however, is that the rising population of the industrial nations has not suffered from a major epidemic since the last century. The modern world supports millions who come into close contact with each other every day, in offices and shops, on public transport, in crowded streets.",

            "Life is ordered by the need to work so as to be able to buy the goods. The day is divided into periods of work and rest. Holidays come in specific months for specific times. The money earned at work is either spent or invested in other people’s work. In the modern factory production system few of those on the conveyer belt see the final result of their labours. In this democracy of possessions what we possess is inalienably ours, private property protected by strict legislation from appropriation by any other individual or by the state. Most of us have the right of free speech. Each of us, at least in the Western world, has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.",
