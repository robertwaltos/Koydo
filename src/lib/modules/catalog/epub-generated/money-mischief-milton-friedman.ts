We often speak of someone \"making money,\" when we really mean that he or she is receiving an income. We do not mean that he or she has a printing press in the basement churning out greenbacked pieces of paper. In this use, money is a synonym for income or receipts; it refers to a flow, to income or receipts per week or per year. We also speak of someone's having money in his or her pocket or in a safe-deposit box or on deposit at a bank. In that use, money refers to an asset, a component of one's total wealth.",

It is a what-if examination of a hypothetical development that, as I have argued in chapter 3, would have had major and far-reaching effects, not only in the United States but in the entire world. As such, my results are inevitably subject to much uncertainty and wide margins of error, which I have tried to allow for in reaching the conclusions stated in chapter 3. This chapter is also highly technical and detailed. I suspect it will be of interest primarily to fellow practitioners of technical economics.",

He ran on a platform committed to \"free silver\" at \"16 to 1\"—that is, the adoption of a bimetallic monetary standard at mint prices for gold and silver whereby 16 ounces of silver would have the same value as 1 ounce of gold. His Republican opponent, William McKinley, ran on a platform committed to the retention of a monometallic gold standard. McKinley beat Bryan by a popular vote margin of less than 10 percent. That was the high point of the free-silver movement. Although Bryan was twice again the Democratic nominee, he lost by increasingly wide margins.",

Metals have been the most widely used, the precious metals of silver and gold above all. As between them, \"silver composed nearly the entire circulating metallic currency of Europe\" until at least the late nineteenth century (Martin 1977, p. 642), and also of India and other parts of Asia. Gold was used much less, primarily for high-valued transactions. The rate of exchange between silver and gold was sometimes specified by the authorities, sometimes left to the market.",

The farm lobby supported silver purchases partly because it favored any measure that would produce inflation and thereby raise the prices of farm products—prices that had plummeted during the Great Depression. In addition, the farm lobby wanted to get the support of the silver lobby for other price inflation devices contained in the Farm Relief Bill.",

Typically there was a small seignorage charge to cover the cost of minting, though sometimes, as in Great Britain and the United States, there was none.

The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose. —JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES (1920, p. 236) The Chinese hyperinflation is a striking example of Keynes's dictum.",

The result was a disaster for Chile, an outstanding success for Israel. The two episodes provide a striking example of how the same monetary action can lead to very different results, depending on circumstances. The episodes also serve to clarify the fundamental difference between two superficially similar monetary standards: pegged exchange rates and a unified currency. Chile When General Augusto Pinochet overthrew the government of Salvador Allende, which had been in power in Chile since November 1970, and replaced it with a military junta in September 1973, he inherited a battered economy and an inflation of more than 500 percent a year.",

            "If the Chiang Kai-shek regime had been able to avoid inflation or keep it to single- or even low double-digit rates, whether by better management of its finances and its monetary policy or because of a different silver policy of the United States in the 1930s, the odds are high that China today would be a wholly different society. War and revolution have been the progenitors of most hyperinflations. The earliest episodes in the West are the U.S. Revolution, with its Continental currency, and the French Revolution, with its assignats —both paper currencies that ultimately became nearly worthless. The many earlier inflations included no hyperinflations for one simple reason.",
