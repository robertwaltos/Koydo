            "Introduction The First Modern War T he Civil War has a powerfully mysterious effect on Americans. The present age seems to be so dismissive of the past, yet the Civil War as a topic of interest is more popular than ever. Few other events in U.S. history can match the rich symbolism and emotional appeal of the Civil War. Images of the war abound in American culture: blue and gray, Abraham Lincoln, Confederate flags, Lee and Grant, Emancipation, Pickett’s Charge, Sherman’s March to the Sea, Gettysburg, and Appomattox. Outside of these images, though, the average person with more than a passing interest in the war has no place to go to gain a broad, general understanding of the events and people who were engaged in this conflict.",

But what guides the actions and purpose of armies in war? That’s where strategy comes in. Strategy is developed at the national level. In the case of the Civil War, the president and his military advisors dictated the strategy. Strategy takes into account a number of important considerations. One of these is an assessment of the resources of the nation — essentially a measurement of its ability to conduct a war and sustain armies in the field. Another is the analysis of the geography.",

Comparing Northern and Southern Resources For the North and the South, any strategy had to be based on an assessment of resources. What were the elements of power for both nations? How could they be used to accomplish the war aims of each nation? These elements of power become the resources (both tangible and intangible) that the Union and the Confederacy would rely on to fight this war. Whoever would win would apply these resources in the best manner over time. Sometimes, as in the case with the Union, some resources are not instantly apparent before the war.",
