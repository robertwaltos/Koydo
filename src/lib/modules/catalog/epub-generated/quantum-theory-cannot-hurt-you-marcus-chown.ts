Julian Brown It’s 2041. A boy sits at a computer in his bedroom. It’s not an ordinary computer. It’s a quantum computer.

Satisfied, the boy shuts the computer down and goes out to play, his night’s homework done. Surely, no computer could possibly do what the boy’s computer has just done? Not only could a computer do such a thing, crude versions are already in existence today.

The coin is in a strong box sitting in the mud at the bottom of the deepest ocean trench. Don’t ask what has set the coin spinning or what is keeping it spinning. This isn’t a well-thought-out story! The point is that there is an identical spinning coin in an identical box sitting on a cold moon in a distant galaxy on the far side of the Universe. The first coin comes down heads.

The cosmic speed limit in our Universe is the speed of light. 1 Since the coins are separated by 10 billion light-years, information about the state of one coin must take a minimum of 10 billion years to reach the other.

            "THINGS YOU CAN’T TELL APART INTERFERE Recall that all the bizarre behaviour in the microscopic world, such as an atom’s ability to be in many places at once, comes down to interference. In the double slit experiment, for example, it is the interference between the wave corresponding to a particle going through the left-hand slit and the wave corresponding to the particle going through the right-hand slit that produces the characteristic pattern of alternating dark and light stripes on the second screen. Recall also that if you were to set up some means of determining which slit each particle goes through—enabling you to distinguish between the two alternative events—the interference stripes disappear because of decoherence.",

            "TWO TRIBES OF PARTICLES Recall the case in which the nuclei are different—a carbon nucleus and a helium nucleus—and consider again the two possible collision events. In one, the nuclei strike each other with a glancing blow, and in the other they hit head on and bounce back almost the way they came. What this means is that, for the nucleus that comes in at 9:00, there is a wave corresponding to it going out at 4:00 and a wave corresponding to it going out at 10:00. The key thing to understand here is that the probability of an event is not related to the height of the wave associated with that event but to the square of the height of the wave.",

            "Interference, it turns out, happens only if the alternative events are indistinguishable —in this case, the particle going through one slit and the particle going through the other slit. In the case of the double slit experiment, the alternative events are indistinguishable just as long as nobody looks. But identical particles, such as electrons, raise the possibility of entirely new kinds of indistinguishable events. Think of a teenage boy who plans to go out clubbing with his girlfriend, who happens to have an identical twin sister. Unbeknown to him, his girlfriend decides to stay in and watch TV and sends her twin in her place.",
