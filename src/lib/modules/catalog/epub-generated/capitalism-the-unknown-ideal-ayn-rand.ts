AYN RAND and the Objectivists launch a major offensive in the name of a new morality. In one fiery article after another they show that capitalism is still an unknown ideal, threatened with destruction without a hearing, “without any public knowledge of its principles, its nature, its history, or its moral meaning.” The political philosophy of Miss Rand’s bestselling novels is presented here in a challenging new appraisal of our era, by the “radicals for capitalism.”",

Our approach can best be summarized by my statement in the first issue of The Objectivist Newsletter (January 1962): “Objectivism is a philosophical movement; since politics is a branch of philosophy, Objectivism advocates certain political principles—specifically, those of laissez-faire capitalism—as the consequence and the ultimate practical application of its fundamental philosophical principles. It does not regard politics as a separate or primary goal, that is: as a goal that can be achieved without a wider ideological context. “Politics is based on three other philosophical disciplines: metaphysics, epistemology and ethics—on a theory of man’s nature and of man’s relationship to existence.",

Today’s frantic development in the field of technology has a quality reminiscent of the days preceding the economic crash of 1929: riding on the momentum of the past, on the unacknowledged remnants of an Aristotelian epistemology, it is a hectic, feverish expansion, heedless of the fact that its theoretical account is long since overdrawn—that in the field of scientific theory, unable to integrate or interpret their own data, scientists are abetting the resurgence of a primitive mysticism.",

The overwhelming majority of mankind—the people who die on the battlefields or starve and perish among the ruins—do not want war. They never wanted it.

In political economy, one may observe the attempt to study and to devise social systems without reference to man . The Objectivist Newsletter, November and December 1965.

If your answer is “yes”—then ask yourself what sort of monstrous injustice you are condoning, supporting, or perpetrating. That group is the American businessmen. The defense of minority rights is acclaimed today, virtually by everyone, as a moral principle of a high order. But this principle, which forbids discrimination, is ap-plied by most of the “liberal” intellectuals in a discriminatory manner: it is applied only to racial or religious minorities.

COMMON FALLACIES ABOUT CAPITALISM by Nathaniel Branden MONOPOLIES IN A SOCIETY OF LAISSEZ-FAIRE CAPITALISM, WHAT WOULD PREVENT THE FORMATION OF POWERFUL MONOPOLIES ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE ECONOMY? One of the worst fallacies in the field of economics—propagated by Karl Marx and accepted by almost everyone today, including many businessmen—is the notion that the development of monopolies is an inescapable and intrinsic result of the operation of a free, unregulated economy. In fact, the exact opposite is true. It is a free market that makes monopolies impossible.",

            "6. GOLD AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM by Alan Greenspan An almost hysterical antagonism toward the gold standard is one issue which unites statists of all persuasions. They seem to sense—perhap more clearly and subtly than many consistent defenders of laissez-faire—that gold and economic freedom are inseparable, that the gold standard is an instrument of laissez-faire and that each implies and requires the other. In order to understand the source of their antagonism, it is necessary first to understand the specific role of gold in a free society. Money is the common denominator of all economic transactions.",

            "It is imperative that one be clear and specific in one’s definition of “monopoly.” When people speak, in an economic or political context, of the dangers and evils of monopoly, what they mean is a coercive monopoly— i.e., exclusive control of a given field of production which is closed to and exempt from competition, so that those controlling the field are able to set arbitrary production policies and charge arbitrary prices, independent of the market, immune from the law of supply and demand. Such a monopoly, it is important to note, entails more than the absence of competition; it entails the impossibility of competition. That is a coercive monopoly’s characteristic attribute, which is essential to any condemnation of such a monopoly.",
