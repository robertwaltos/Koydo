During our most recent fiscal upheaval in the United States, one out of every two economists with a job drew his or her paycheck from a government institution. Your economist, your elected official, and your friendly neighborhood bureaucrat, your policy wonk, even your favorite mainstream journalist believes that you—the individual—couldn’t possibly know what you are doing with your own money. They think you’re too stupid to make the right decision when faced with choices in the marketplace. If you agree with them, then I’d respectfully advise you to stop reading this book right now.",

            "Prologue The Brave New World of Elastic Money Mankind has used money for more than 2500 years. For most of history money has been a commodity and most frequently gold or silver. There are good reasons why gold and silver have held this unique position. These precious metals possess some characteristics that make them particularly useful as monetary commodities, such as homogeneity, durability, divisibility, and, last but not least, relative scarcity. The supply of these metals is essentially fixed. Gold and silver can be mined but only at considerable expense. Their supply cannot be expanded quickly and inexpensively. For most societies throughout history, the supply of money was therefore essentially inelastic. Today we use money that is very different from what the vast majority of our ancestors used.",

Money is useful only if there is exchange, and exchange is possible only if property or, more precisely, private property exists. 1 In a communist commonwealth, where every resource is owned and allocated by the state, there would be no place for money. In contrast, capitalism can be defined as “a social system based on the explicit recognition of private property and of nonaggressive, contractual exchanges between private property owners.” 2 In such a system money will quickly become indispensable. Of course, private property owners can exchange property without the help of money.",

If one of the two parties has nothing to offer that the other party has use for, then the trade will not take place. Economists call this condition “double coincidence of wants,” and it severely restricts the number of transactions that will occur in a barter economy.

            "Part Two: THE EFFECTS OF MONEY INJECTIONS Chapter 3 Money Injections without Credit Markets We will start our analysis of the effects of an expanding money supply with a model that is purely a mental construct. It is a simple thought experiment that was famously used by David Hume about 250 years ago in his essay “Of Interest.” 1 Even, Instant, and Transparent Money Injection Let us assume that a money producer increases the individual cash balances of every person in society through an act of magic by exactly 10 percent overnight. If a person had $1,000 in money the evening before, that person will now have $1,100 in money holdings. A person who had $50 in money will now have $55.",

            "Chapter 4 Money Injections via Credit Markets In this chapter we will further enhance the realism of our model of money injections from Chapter 3. We will now introduce the market for credit. Most money creation today occurs via the fractional-reserve banking industry or the central bank. Banks operate in the loan market, and this is where money is being injected into the economy in the real world. A functioning loan market would obviously also exist in a world of inflexible commodity money and without fractional-reserve or central banks. The loan market is one of the institutions that help channel savings into investments, which is an essential part of any capitalistic economy.",

            "The overall amount of money in the economy thereby increases by 10 percent but, importantly, this happens instantaneously, with everybody affected at the same time and in exactly the same way. This is a one-off event; no additional money injections follow. We will make one additional assumption: Every person, as he wakes up and goes about his business, not only knows immediately that he magically received an additional 10 percent of cash, but he also knows that everybody else has received an additional 10 percent of their previous money holdings, too. This is, of course, a most unrealistic example of money injections.",
