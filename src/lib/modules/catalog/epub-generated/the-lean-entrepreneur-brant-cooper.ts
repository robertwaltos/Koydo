My personal background was as an engineer and my companies had been web-based startups, so that is what I wrote about. Struggling to explain the successes and failures of those companies, I discussed principles like continuous deployment, customer development, and a hyper-accelerated form of agile. When I delved into lean manufacturing, I discovered the concepts and terminology dovetailed. The result: a new idea I called The Lean Startup.",

You can never step in the same river twice (Heraclitus) and all that. Change isn’t constant. We change constantly, but at different rates, depending where we are on the curve. Fast change comes in times of cheap experimentation. Massive new life emerged on Earth during time periods in which a convergence of foundational platforms, like the different aspects of Earth’s biosphere, favored the emergence of diverse species, most of which failed. Massive new technologies emerge when the discovery and extraction of massive amounts of resources (water, minerals, fuel) provides low-cost industrial experiments, most of which fail.",

The feeling has come upon him before but never like this, never so strong. He shakes his head and returns his gaze to the mysterious prose before him. He tries to focus on the bits of historical text requiring mental gymnastics and re-imagination. His mind blurs and the words spin up on the page as if in a magical vortex. “Blast it all!” he exclaims as he slams shut the sturdy volume. “Curse this infernal vision!” With a heavy sigh, Visdorf pushes himself away from the sturdy dining table and stands up.",

The end success rarely matches the initial vision exactly, and sometimes the end result is hardly recognizable at all. The vision simply becomes part of the ex post facto narrative that makes us feel good about the visionary-turned-billionaire. When corporate consultants and coaches insist you write a vision statement, they want you to project where you will be in five years. This is the sort of thing that leads to those horribly mundane opening lines in “about us” statements—“Industry leader in blah, blah, blah.” 1 Those are the businesses with the management teams full of pre-billionaire visionaries.",

            "Chapter 4 Wading in the Value Stream Articulating the Value Stream In lean manufacturing, an organization’s value stream is comprised of all activities undertaken to provide value to the customer. Activities include everything from developing the concept of a product to its design, engineering, manufacturing, and delivery. As we’ve discussed, the value stream in a lean enterprise includes both value-added activities (for example, assembling part of a car) and non-value-added activities (for example, forklifting parts across a warehouse floor). The objective of lean is to eliminate as many of the non-value-added processes as possible (some are necessary) and to optimize the efficiency of the value-added activities, while maintaining the established value to the customer.",

            "Chapter 5 Diving In King Sisyphus angered the Greek god Zeus with his hubris and avarice. His punishment? To roll a boulder up a steep hill, only to see it roll back down before he reached the apex and to be forced to begin again. For eternity! This is what they do with those more concerned with creating wealth than value in Greek mythology! Albert Camus, leaving aside the nature of King Sisyphus and what got him into his predicament, believed the struggle of rolling the boulder uphill to be life affirming and believed the King, in the end, found contentment.",

            "The value being produced should never be adversely affected by process optimization, the elimination of activities, or other improvements. Destroying real value is more wasteful than eliminating inefficient time, money, or raw resources utilization. An organization may or may not be better off becoming more efficient through elimination of waste independent of its effect on value creation. The latter may be the goal in some organizations, but it isn’t lean . In the context of a lean startup, in which the production and delivery of value hasn’t been proven, you don’t truly know either the value being created or for whom it’s being created. You may think you know.",
