High-performing teams go beyond this baseline: they exhibit deep trust, constructive conflict, unwavering commitment to decisions, mutual accountability without defensiveness, and a relentless focus on collective results over individual credit. Google's Project Aristotle found that psychological safety was the single strongest predictor of team effectiveness."

Teams produce collective work products that exceed what individuals could achieve alone. Leaders must diagnose whether a team or a working group is appropriate for the task. Forcing teamwork on tasks suited to individual contribution wastes time, while treating team tasks as individual work sacrifices the synergy and innovation that true collaboration produces."

(4) Performing — the team operates with high autonomy, flexibility, and focus on results. (5) Adjourning — the team disbands after achieving its purpose. Teams do not always progress linearly; they may regress under stress or with membership changes."

During storming, facilitate healthy conflict resolution and reinforce shared purpose — do not suppress disagreement. During norming, step back and let the team own its processes. During performing, delegate broadly and focus on removing barriers. During adjourning, celebrate achievements and capture lessons learned. The leader who uses the same style throughout all stages will either stifle a mature team or leave an immature one without needed guidance."

Susan Wheelan's research showed that teams given deliberate development support reached the performing stage significantly faster than those left to evolve naturally."

Brainstorm multiple possibilities without judgment. (4) Will (or Way Forward) — what will the coachee commit to doing? Establish specific actions, timelines, and accountability.

Balance reinforcing feedback (what to continue) with redirecting feedback (what to change). Create a feedback-rich culture where input flows in all directions — up, down, and laterally. Research by Marcial Losada suggests that high-performing teams maintain a ratio of roughly three positive interactions for every negative one."

Weekly team meetings address broader coordination and problem-solving. Monthly retrospectives promote continuous improvement. Asynchronous tools — shared documents, recorded updates, discussion boards — respect time zones and reduce meeting fatigue.
