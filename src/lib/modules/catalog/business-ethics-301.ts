Ethical universalism counters that certain moral principles — such as prohibitions against torture, slavery, and corruption — apply everywhere regardless of local customs. In global business, this tension surfaces constantly: Is a gift to a government official a legitimate cultural practice or bribery? The answer depends on which ethical lens you apply."

He argued that multinational companies should respect genuine cultural differences in customs, traditions, and business practices — but must never violate core human rights or fundamental ethical principles. His framework identifies a threshold: practices that merely differ from home-country norms (gift-giving customs, negotiation styles) should be respected, while practices that violate basic human dignity (child labor, forced labor, dangerous working conditions) must be rejected regardless of local acceptance."

Facilitation payments to speed routine government services are legal under the FCPA but prohibited by the UK Bribery Act. Nepotism in hiring may be culturally expected in relationship-based societies but conflicts with merit-based principles. Companies navigating these zones need clear codes of conduct, local ethics advisors, and the willingness to lose business rather than compromise core principles."

The FCPA applies to U.S. companies, their subsidiaries, foreign companies listed on U.S. exchanges, and any person acting within U.S. territory.

The Act has no exception for facilitation payments and applies to any company doing business in the UK, regardless of where the bribery occurs."

          "content": "ESG reporting faces significant challenges. The lack of standardization means companies can cherry-pick favorable metrics. ESG ratings from different agencies often disagree because they weight factors differently. Data quality and comparability remain poor, especially for Scope 3 emissions and social metrics. Critics from the left argue ESG is a distraction from binding regulation; critics from the right call it political ideology masquerading as investing. Despite these problems, the direction is toward mandatory, standardized, and audited ESG disclosure — moving from voluntary storytelling to regulated accountability."
