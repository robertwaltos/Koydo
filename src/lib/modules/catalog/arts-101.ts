Geometric shapes like circles, squares, and triangles have exact measurements. Organic shapes like clouds and leaves are irregular and found in nature."

Texture is how a surface feels or looks like it feels — smooth, rough, bumpy, or soft. You can create texture in a drawing by using dots, lines, or shading. Vincent van Gogh's thick paint strokes created real texture you can feel on the canvas."

Form is a 3D shape — a sphere instead of a circle, a cube instead of a square. Artists create the illusion of form on flat paper using shading and perspective."
