Learning these terms will help us communicate effectively about data systems. We will also define the boundaries within which we operate, which means we will clarify how different components of data systems work together and interact. Furthermore, we will explore the relationship between pipeline architecture and data quality contracts in real-world scenarios. This understanding is crucial for ensuring that our data processes are efficient and reliable. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid grasp of these important concepts and how they apply in practice."
