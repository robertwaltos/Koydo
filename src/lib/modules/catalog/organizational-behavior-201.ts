Informal groups — lunch circles, interest-based networks — often exert as much influence on behavior as formal structures. Understanding both is essential for managing effectively."

Storming: conflict emerges as members assert individual ideas, challenge authority, and compete for influence — many teams stall here. Norming: the group establishes shared expectations, develops trust, and agrees on working methods. Roles become clearer and cohesion strengthens."

Adjourning (added by Tuckman in 1977): the group disbands after completing its task, which can bring both satisfaction and sadness. Amazon's two-pizza team model — keeping teams small enough to be fed by two pizzas — is designed to help groups move through these stages faster by reducing coordination overhead."

Max Ringelmann first documented this in 1913 with rope-pulling experiments, finding that individual effort decreased as group size increased. Causes include diffusion of responsibility (someone else will pick up the slack), perceived dispensability (my contribution does not matter), and lack of evaluation (nobody is tracking individual effort). Cultural context matters — collectivist cultures like Japan show less social loafing than individualist ones."

The Bay of Pigs invasion and the Challenger disaster are classic examples where groupthink contributed to catastrophic decisions."

To prevent groupthink: assign a devil's advocate role, encourage critical evaluation, invite outside experts, use anonymous input methods, and have leaders withhold their opinions initially. Jeff Bezos's practice of requiring written memos before meetings at Amazon serves partly as a groupthink prevention mechanism — forcing independent thinking before group discussion begins."

Process conflict — disputes about how to do the work — falls in between. The key is managing conflict intensity: too little produces apathy and groupthink, too much causes hostility and paralysis."

Competing: high assertiveness, low cooperativeness — win at others' expense. Accommodating: low assertiveness, high cooperativeness — yield to preserve harmony.

Accommodating works when the issue matters more to the other party, or when preserving the relationship is paramount. Avoiding suits trivial issues or when tensions need time to cool. Compromising is useful under time pressure when parties have equal power. Collaborating is ideal for complex issues where both parties' concerns are too important to trade off, though it demands the most time and trust."
