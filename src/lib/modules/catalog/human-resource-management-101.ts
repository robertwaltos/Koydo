HRM encompasses the policies, practices, and systems that influence employees' behavior, attitudes, and performance. Core functions include workforce planning, recruitment, training, compensation, performance management, and employee relations. Unlike simple administration, modern HRM aligns people strategy with business strategy."

          "content": "Traditional personnel management was reactive and administrative — processing payroll, maintaining records, and enforcing rules. Strategic HRM, by contrast, is proactive and integrated with business planning. It views employees as human capital — investments that generate returns through productivity, innovation, and customer satisfaction. This shift began in the 1980s when scholars like Dave Ulrich argued that HR must be a strategic business partner, not just an administrative function."

Companies like Southwest Airlines and Google have built enduring advantages through distinctive people practices that competitors struggle to copy."
