- Status update (2026-03-02): onboarding submission flow now routes through
  `POST /api/ai/placement-diagnostic` (with stage-scoped question generation via
  `GET /api/ai/placement-diagnostic`), removing direct profile writes from
  `student/onboarding`. Placement summary now reflects manual overrides first,
  history API now supports strict role-scoped access (`self`, `parent`, `teacher`),
  and placement integration contract coverage + retention tooling were added via
  `scripts/test-placement-diagnostic-flow-contract.mjs` and

  and JSON run reports; `scripts/seed-audiobook-translations.ts` now supports
  per-chapter retry controls (`SEED_CHAPTER_RETRIES`, `SEED_CHAPTER_RETRY_DELAY_MS`),

  for parent/teacher portal APIs and role-scoped learner access enforcement.
  Placement history now enforces strict `self|parent|teacher` scope checks with
  child/class authorization constraints in `GET /api/ai/placement-diagnostic/history`.
- Status update (2026-03-02): parent child-data access hardening consolidated via
  `src/lib/compliance/parent-access.ts` (explicit purpose + parent role + verified consent checks),
  now applied to `POST /api/parent/digest`, `GET /api/parent/reports`,
  `GET /api/parent/ai-interventions`, and parent-scoped placement history.
- Status update (2026-03-02): release-gate stabilization patch landed after detecting a
  cross-agent UI import regression (`@/app/components/ui/physical-button` not found).
  Updated `src/components/games/number-crunch.tsx` and `src/components/games/shape-safari.tsx`
  to use shared `@/components/experience/PhysicalButton`, and posted a coordination
  confirmation request in `../V1-LAUNCH-COORDINATION.md` for recent game/UI owners.
- Status update (2026-03-02): parent language reports API hardening completed at
  `GET /api/parent/reports/language` by replacing direct parent-owned profile assumptions
  with verified consent-scoped child authorization (`parent_language_reports`) and adding
  explicit route rate limiting plus coverage enforcement in
  `scripts/check-api-rate-limit-coverage.mjs`.
- Status update (2026-03-02): teacher placement-history authorization hardened with shared
  compliance guard `src/lib/compliance/teacher-access.ts`, now enforcing class ownership,
  learner enrollment, and `parent_consent` before serving teacher-scoped
  `GET /api/ai/placement-diagnostic/history` access.
- Status update (2026-03-02): teacher classroom API hardening completed by unifying
  class ownership checks behind `resolveVerifiedTeacherClassAccess` across
  `GET /api/testing/classes/[classId]/analytics`,
  `GET/POST /api/testing/classes/[classId]/enrollments`, and
  `GET/POST /api/testing/classes/[classId]/assignments`, with route-level
  rate limiting and coverage enforcement in `scripts/check-api-rate-limit-coverage.mjs`.
- Status update (2026-03-02): teacher authorization contract harness added via
  `npm run teacher:access:contract:test` (`scripts/test-teacher-access-contract.mjs`)
  to lock class ownership + enrollment + parent-consent enforcement behavior.
- Status update (2026-03-02): teacher class index/create surface hardening completed for
  `GET/POST /api/testing/classes` by adding explicit teacher-role verification through
  shared compliance helper `resolveVerifiedTeacherRole` plus route-level throttles
  (`api:testing:classes:get`, `api:testing:classes:post`). Teacher contract harness now
  also validates role-purpose checks and non-teacher rejection paths.

  executive lawsuit-risk summary, contract control requirements, and reusable app/code
  audit prompt in `EDTECH-LITIGATION-CONTRACT-HARDENING.md`. Next tranche will wire
  backend guard checks for consent, retention, and licensing evidence gates.
- Status update (2026-03-02): consent hardening implementation started with shared
  backend parent-access guard enforcing purpose-of-use + verified consent relationships
  before serving child learning data from parent surfaces.
- Status update (2026-03-02): testing content legal guardrails hardened in
  `POST /api/testing/exams/[examId]/start` and
  `POST /api/testing/attempts/[attemptId]/submit` to fail closed in production
  when governance columns are missing and to enforce approved/commercially-allowed
  question scope during governed-mode attempt submission. Added automated marker
  coverage check via `npm run security:testing-content-legal-guard:check`.
- Status update (2026-03-02): webhook compliance hardening added for billing ingestion:
  Stripe now enforces explicit signature tolerance and blocks test-mode events in production,
  RevenueCat now treats `SUBSCRIBER_ALIAS` as non-mutating and enforces strict purchase payload
  validation (`product_id` required for purchase events, bounded identifier length, timestamp sanity checks).
  Added automated billing marker coverage check via

  billing backend lane: RevenueCat completion hardening, webhook idempotency/contract tests,
  and parent/teacher/developer billing portal backend surfaces.
- Status update (2026-03-02): webhook claim locking hardened for both Stripe and RevenueCat
  (`POST /api/stripe/webhook`, `POST /api/revenuecat/webhook`) to reduce concurrent duplicate
  processing by honoring active `processing` locks and optimistic status-guarded claims.
  Added shared lock helper `src/lib/billing/webhook-processing-lock.ts` and contract test
  `scripts/test-billing-webhook-processing-lock.mjs`.
- Status update (2026-03-02): webhook resilience and contract gates strengthened:
  Stripe now rejects empty payloads and enforces explicit signature replay tolerance,
  production blocks `livemode=false` events, and RevenueCat prevents alias events from
  mutating subscriptions while rejecting malformed purchase payloads early.
  Billing webhook protections are now codified in release automation through
  `scripts/check-billing-webhook-hardening-coverage.mjs` and preflight integration.
- Status update (2026-03-02): billing abuse-guard coverage expanded across checkout
  and account-management surfaces. Added route-level limiter to
  `GET /api/subscription/status` (`api:subscription:status:get`) and extended
  `scripts/check-api-rate-limit-coverage.mjs` to enforce markers for
  `POST /api/stripe/checkout`, `POST /api/stripe/checkout/gift`,
  `POST /api/stripe/checkout/organization`, and `POST /api/stripe/portal`.
- Status update (2026-03-02): webhook retention/cleanup strategy added with bounded
  operational tooling `scripts/cleanup-billing-webhook-events.mjs` (default dry-run,
  age threshold + per-table delete caps, optional failed-event inclusion) for both
  `stripe_webhook_events` and `revenuecat_webhook_events`. Added npm command
  `billing:webhook:events:cleanup` for scheduled maintenance windows.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Compatibility suite passes current app billing flows.
  - Dashboard parity for offerings/packages/entitlements/customers.
  - Apple/Google webhook ingestion with replay-safe idempotency.
