# Koydo V1 Launch Roadmap

Last Updated: 2026-02-27 (refreshed end-of-day)
Owner: Koydo Core Team (Claude Code + Codex + Gemini)

> **Coordination doc**: See `V1-LAUNCH-COORDINATION.md` (project root) for agent
> assignments, file ownership, and the day-by-day sprint plan.
>
> **Launch command center**: See `../LAUNCH-COMMAND-CENTER.md` for active lock
> ownership, execution order, and append-only progress protocol.

## Status Legend
- `DONE`: implemented and validated
- `IN_PROGRESS`: active execution now
- `PENDING`: queued for upcoming tranche

## V1 Launch Strategy

**Target date**: 2026-03-13 (14-day sprint from 2026-02-27)

### Launch focus reset (effective now)

- Scope lock on launch-critical work only.
- Release order is now: **Web -> Google Play -> iOS (parallel)**.
- All agents must follow lock ownership in `LAUNCH-COMMAND-CENTER.md`.
- EN/ES + stability + security are hard launch gates (not optional polish).

### Three launch surfaces (priority order)

1. **Web** (immediate) — production-grade public site, top-notch landing page
2. **Google Play** (fast follow) — Android via Capacitor/TWA wrapper
3. **iOS App Store** (parallel) — iPad/iPhone via Capacitor + Xcode

### Business model

- **Freemium** — free tier with curated content per education stage
- **Paid** — subscription unlocks full catalog + premium features
- **Billing**: Apple IAP (iOS), Google Play Billing (Android), Stripe (web)

### Languages: English + Spanish (mandatory at launch)

### Education stages (replaces 6 Pre-K worlds on lobby)

| Stage | Ages | Grades | Badge |
|---|---|---|---|
| Little Explorers | 3–5 | Pre-K | 🧒 |
| First Adventures | 5–8 | K–2 | 🌈 |
| Discovery Lab | 8–11 | 3–5 | 🔬 |
| Challenge Zone | 11–14 | 6–8 | ⚡ |
| Launchpad | 14–18 | 9–12 | 🚀 |
| Mastery Studio | 18+ | College+ | 🎓 |

## Phase 1 Launch Objective (original — still valid)

Ship the highest-value content experience first: stable media pipeline, reviewed launch assets, and reliable app wiring for generated visuals.

## Workstream Tracker

| ID | Workstream | Status | Owner | Notes / Deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1-01 | Grok manifest audit + 200-sample review workflow | DONE | Codex | `media:manifest:audit` defaulted to 200; normalized/test/audit artifacts generated. |
| P1-02 | Manifest normalization fixes (`a ocean`, `/public` path handling) | DONE | Codex | Added normalization in `scripts/media-manifest-audit.mjs`; warnings remain in source manifest but normalized outputs are safe. |
| P1-03 | App wiring: admin manifest consumer API | DONE | Codex | Added `GET /api/admin/media/catalog` backed by `GROK-IMAGE-MANIFEST-NORMALIZED.json`. |
| P1-04 | App wiring: media resolve fallback continuity | DONE | Codex | `GET /api/media/resolve` + `/batch` now return generated fallback assets when DB job output is missing. |
| P1-05 | Controlled video queue draining (batch operations) | DONE | Claude/Codex | Overnight runner completed. 1,831 image+video jobs regenerated with enriched prompts. Old `output_url` archived in `metadata.old_output_url` as fallback; resolve API serves old media during regen so app stays functional. |
| P1-05b | Prompt enrichment + full media regen | DONE | Claude | `generate-lesson-media-prompts.mjs` rewritten — prompts now include module description, all learning objectives, visual aid briefs, age range, difficulty. All 6,720 generated prompts bulk-approved (`approve-prompts.mjs`). `regen-media.mjs` reset 1,655 images + 176 videos to re-queue. Resolve API updated with `regen_in_progress_fallback` source for old media continuity. |
| P1-06 | Manifest consumers rollout in admin UI | DONE | Claude | Added "Reviewed Media Catalog" section to `media-ops-client.tsx`; calls `GET /api/admin/media/catalog`; supports group/usagePath/search filters + pagination; shows asset cards with prompt preview and public_url link. |
| P1-07 | Curate Phase-1 launch content set from reviewed 200 | PENDING | Team | Approve exact asset subset for production queueing and content placement. |
| P1-08 | Queue by approved reviewed-set only (safety gate) | DONE | Claude/Codex | Added `--reviewed-only` flag to `queue-media-from-prompts.mjs`, `queue-immersive-media.mjs`, and `process-media-jobs.mjs`. Gate filters by `promptQaStatus === "reviewed"` at queue time and `metadata->prompt_qa_status = 'reviewed'` in DB at process time. New npm scripts: `media:queue:from-prompts:reviewed`, `media:queue:immersive:reviewed`. |
| P1-09 | Language feature architecture baseline (pluggable providers) | DONE | Existing | `LANGUAGE_LEARNING_ARCHITECTURE.md` + provider contracts already present in codebase. |
| P1-10 | High-confidence pronunciation grading at scale | PENDING | Later Phase | Decision locked: licensed pronunciation provider in parallel with AI fallback behind pluggable layer. |
| P1-11 | Full provider interface expansion (STT/translation/TTS/scoring) | PENDING | Later Phase | Explicitly deferred until after Phase 1 launch content goals are complete. |
| P1-12 | Media processor reliability hardening (safe claims + help guard) | DONE | Codex | `process-media-jobs.mjs` now claims jobs one-by-one (`queued -> running`) and supports `--help` to avoid accidental long-running starts. |
| P1-13 | Dark theme contrast and tonal calibration | PENDING | Codex/Design | Reduce visual contrast shock and abrupt color jumps; establish stable semantic tokens before launch. |
| P1-14 | Language policy constants (weights, confidence gate, gamification + budget caps) | DONE | Codex | Added `src/lib/language-learning/policy.ts` with locked defaults and rollout waves. |
| P1-15 | Pronunciation API confidence safety mode (`practice_only`) | DONE | Codex | `POST /api/language/pronunciation/grade` now returns `gradingMode` + `gradeRecorded` using confidence threshold policy. |
| P1-16 | Language + gamification DB foundation (RLS-ready) | DONE | Codex | Added migration `202602280004_language_pronunciation_gamification_foundation.sql` for attempts/states/events tables. |
| P1-17 | Education stage lobby (6-stage redesign) | DONE | Claude | Replaced 6 Pre-K world cards with 6 education stages (Pre-K → College). New `EducationStage` type in `scenes.ts`, `StageLinkCard` component, updated explore lobby + home page. |
| P1-18 | Free-tier content curation (7-10 modules per stage) | DONE | Claude | Created `src/lib/content-gating/` with stage→module curation map. 48 modules across 6 stages in free tier (depth-passed + external imports prioritized). `getModulesForStage()`, `isModuleFree()` API. |
| P1-19 | Content gating UI (free vs premium) | DONE | Claude | `StageModuleGrid` component shows curated modules with FREE/PREMIUM badges, lock overlay on premium cards, module counts in stage header. Stage detail view at `/explore?stage={id}`. |
| P1-20 | Loading/error/empty states for explore + root | DONE | Claude | Added `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx` for root app and explore route. Skeleton loaders match page structure. Error pages have retry + navigation. |
| P1-21 | Launch command center + lock protocol | DONE | Codex | Added `../LAUNCH-COMMAND-CENTER.md` with strict read/append + file lock rules. |
| P1-22 | Store sequence reset (Web, then Google Play, iOS parallel) | DONE | Team | Roadmap/targets aligned to web-first. Google Play + iOS parallel track. Store assets + submission guides complete. |
| P1-23 | Security + stability hard gate for launch | DONE | Codex | CSRF in proxy.ts, IP rate limiting on 10 endpoints, admin-only media generate, auth scoping fixed on parent digest, RLS on 44 tables + 11 admin policy gaps closed, atomic progress RPC, 0 console.log / 0 TODO/FIXME in src/. |
| P1-24 | EN/ES launch-critical coverage gate | DONE | Codex/Claude | 400+ EN/ES translation keys. All 19 launch-critical pages wired with `t()`. Cookie-first locale with server/client sync. Language switcher in TopNav + dashboard shell. |

## Overnight GPU Runner Runbook

### Standard start (new/first run)

```bash
# Step 1: Regenerate prompt pack + approve all generated prompts
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/generate-lesson-media-prompts.mjs"
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/approve-prompts.mjs"

# Step 2: Queue all remaining unqueued lessons
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/queue-immersive-media.mjs --reviewed-only --limit 0"

# Step 3: Launch runner detached (survives VS Code close)
python3 /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/launch_overnight.py

# Step 4: Monitor
wsl bash -c "tail -f /tmp/overnight.log"

# Step 5: Check stats
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/_stats.mjs"
```

### Regenerate previously completed media with enriched prompts

```bash
# Step 1: Regen + approve prompts (if not already done)
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && npm run prompts:regen-and-approve"

# Step 2: Reset completed jobs to queued (archives old output_url in metadata)
# Dry-run first:
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/regen-media.mjs"
# Apply:
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/regen-media.mjs --apply"

# Step 3: (optional) Reset stuck jobs from any previous run
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/reset-stuck-jobs.mjs"

# Step 4: Launch runner (or restart if already running)
python3 /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/launch_overnight.py
```

### Restart after VS Code / WSL session close

```bash
# 1. Reset any stuck jobs
wsl bash -c "cd /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/eduforge-web && node scripts/reset-stuck-jobs.mjs"

# 2. Re-launch detached runner
python3 /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/launch_overnight.py
```

### Prompt enrichment workflow (for future re-runs)

When module catalog `.ts` files are updated with new lessons or improved content:
```bash
npm run prompts:regen-and-approve   # regenerate pack + bulk-approve generated prompts
npm run media:regen:apply           # archive old media + reset to queued for fresh generation
python3 /mnt/d/PythonProjects/Koydo/launch_overnight.py  # start runner
```

## Controlled Queue Draining Runbook

Use these commands in `PowerShell` from `d:\PythonProjects\Koydo\eduforge-web` (legacy repo folder name):

```powershell
# 1) Inspect existing candidate pressure without inserting new jobs
npm run media:queue:immersive:test:dry

# 2) Drain queued video jobs in a controlled batch
node scripts/process-media-jobs.mjs --mode video --strict-provider --limit 25

# 3) Retry failed video jobs in bounded batches when needed
node scripts/retry-media-jobs.mjs --status failed --asset video --limit 25 --apply

# 4) Requeue stale running video jobs when needed
node scripts/requeue-stale-media-jobs.mjs --asset video --max-age-minutes 90 --limit 25 --apply

# 5) If a processing run is interrupted, reclaim stranded running jobs quickly
node scripts/requeue-stale-media-jobs.mjs --asset video --max-age-minutes 10 --limit 25 --apply
```

## Decisions Locked

1. Phase 1 focus is launch-critical content and media stability, not broad language-feature buildout.
2. Pronunciation scoring strategy is hybrid by design:
  - licensed assessment provider for high-confidence production grading
  - AI/rule-based fallback through pluggable provider layer.
3. Provider interface scaffolding expansion remains deferred to the post-launch phase.
4. Locked defaults for language-learning tranche-2 foundation:
  - Pronunciation rubric target weights: `accuracy 45% / fluency 35% / prosody 20%`
  - Confidence gate: `asrConfidence < 0.70` => `practice_only`
  - Gamification limits: `3 badges/module`, `20 levels`, `2 daily + 1 weekly quests`
  - AI budget caps: `<= $0.05` total AI per active learner/month, `<= $0.008` LLM per active learner/month
